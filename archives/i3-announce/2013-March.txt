Subject: [i3 announcement] i3 v4.5 released
Message-ID: <x6mwu8hhnb.fsf@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

I just released i3 v4.5. Here are the release notes:

 ????????????????????????????????
 ? Release notes for i3 v4.5    ?
 ????????????????????????????????

This is the i3 v4.5. This version is considered stable. All users of i3 are
strongly encouraged to upgrade.

Most of the changes are cleanups and bugfixes. Due to cleanups, i3 no longer
  depends on flex/bison at all. Furthermore, libev ? 4 is now a hard dependency
  (libev < 4 is not supported anymore).

One important change to note is that moving windows to a different output will
  no longer move focus to that output. If you want to have the old behavior,
  modify the keybindings for moving in your configfile like this:

    bindsym $mod+Shift+1 move workspace 1; workspace 1

Subject: [i3 announcement] i3 v4.5.1 released
Message-ID: <x68v5kbc3w.fsf@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

I just released i3 v4.5.1:

 ????????????????????????????????
 ? Release notes for i3 v4.5.1  ?
 ????????????????????????????????

This is the i3 v4.5.1, a bugfix release. This version is considered stable. All
users of i3 are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

This release fixes an i3 lockup when dragging floating windows from one monitor
  to another.

Furthermore, in the release process for v4.5, there was a human error leading
  to i3 thinking that v4.5 is a debug version, therefore allocating 25 MB of
  shared memory logging ringbuffer by default.

 ??????????????????????????????
 ? Changes in v4.5.1          ?
 ??????????????????????????????

  ? Bugfix: Don?t warp the pointer when dragging floating windows
  ? i3-dmenu-desktop: improve error message when dmenu cannot be found
  ? Add YAJL_CFLAGS to i3-msg.mk
