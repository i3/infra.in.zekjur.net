Subject: [i3 announcement] i3lock 2.6 released
Message-ID: <x6lhrqqzi3.fsf@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

I just released i3lock 2.6. Here is the changelog:

2014-07-18 i3lock 2.6

 • NEW DEPENDENCY: use libxkbcommon-x11 instead of libX11
   This helps us get rid of all code that directly uses libX11
 • Use cairo_status_to_string for descriptive errors.
 • Add `-e` option to not validate empty password.
 • Bugfix: update the initial keyboard modifier state (Thanks lee, Ran)
 • Re-raise i3lock when obscured in a separate process
 • Turn on the screen on successful authentication
 • Delay to turn off the screen after wrong passwd
 • Discard half-entered passwd after some inactivity
 • Ignore empty passwd after repeated Enter keypress
 • Scale the unlock indicator (for retina displays)

Best regards,
Michael
