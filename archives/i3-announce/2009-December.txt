Hi,

a few minutes ago, i3 v3.?-bf1 was released. An upgrade to this version is
recommended to any user running v3.? or older.

Here are the release notes for this version:

This is the first bugfix release (bf1) for version 3.? (transcribed 3.d) of
i3. Because many bugs were fixed after the release of version 3.?, we thought
users of the stable releases might profit from this additional bugfix release.

Thanks for this release go out to msi, merovius, Grauwolf, jace, Syntropy,
Mirko, helgiks and Moredread.

A list of changes follows:

  * Bugfix: Don?t draw window title when titlebar is disabled
  * Bugfix: Correctly switch border types for floating windows
  * Bugfix: Correctly replay pointer if the click handler does not trigger
  * Bugfix: Also allow WORDs as workspace names
  * Bugfix: Correctly clear the urgency hint if a window gets unmapped without
    clearing it
  * Bugfix: Fix resizing of floating windows in borderless/1-px-border mode
  * Bugfix: Accept underscores in bindsym
  * Bugfix: Don?t set the urgency flag if the window is focused
  * Bugfix: Handle stack-limit cols on tabbed containers
  * Bugfix: Resize client after updating base_width/base_height
  * Bugfix: Force render containers after setting the client active
  * Bugfix: Fix two problems in resizing floating windows with right mouse
  * Bugfix: Use more precise floating point arithmetics
  * Bugfix: Correctly place new windows below fullscreen windows
