Subject: [i3 announcement] i3lock 2.0 released
Message-ID: <1283688859-sup-7726@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

a few minutes ago, I released version 2.0 of i3lock.

i3lock is a simple (but improved) screen locker, like slock. You start it, your
screen gets blanked (or an image will be displayed) and stays like this until
you enter your password.

This version of i3lock was completely rewritten (so no longer a fork of slock)
using XCB (instead of Xlib). Some of its features are:
 ? i3lock forks, so you can combine it with an alias to suspend to RAM.
 ? You can specify a background color or a PNG image to display.
 ? You can specify whether i3lock should bell upon a wrong password.
 ? i3lock uses PAM and therefore is compatible with LDAP etcetera.

Get it from?
http://i3.zekjur.net/i3lock/i3lock-2.0.tar.gz
?and verify the GPG signature:
http://i3.zekjur.net/i3lock/i3lock-2.0.tar.gz.asc

Best regards,
Michael

BTW: For the debian users, a new version has been uploaded and will be
available soon.

Subject: [i3 announcement] i3status 2.2 released
Message-ID: <1285196327-sup-2516@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

a few minutes ago, I released version 2.2 of i3status.

i3status is a small program (less than 1000 SLOC) for generating a status bar
for dzen2, xmobar or similar programs. It is designed to be very efficient by
issuing a very small number of system calls, as one generally wants to update
such a status line every second. This ensures that even under high load, your
status bar is updated correctly. Also, it saves a bit of energy by not hogging
your CPU as much as spawning the corresponding amount of shell commands would. 

The changes between i3status 2.1 and i3status 2.2 are:

 ? Implement a discordian date module (like ddate(1))
 ? Implement ALSA volume support
 ? disk: implement %avail (different from %free with regard to the reserved
   space of your filesystem)
 ? wireless: display quality relative to the wireless maximum quality.
 ? wireless: display connection speed (bitrate)
 ? wireless: custom colors for link quality
 ? Bugfix: Treat an interface as 'down' when it cannot be found in
   /proc/net/wireless
 ? Bugfix: Correctly check for interface up/down status

Get it from?

?and verify the GPG signature:

Best regards,
Michael

BTW: As always, I also uploaded a new version to debian. It will be available
soon.
