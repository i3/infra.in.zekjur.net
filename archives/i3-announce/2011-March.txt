Subject: [i3 announcement] i3 -tree *PREVIEW RELEASE 2*
Message-ID: <1299526960-sup-1446@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

(Also check http://i3.zekjur.net/tree/ if you prefer websites).

I just released the second *PREVIEW RELEASE* of the i3 tree branch. Quote from
the release announcement:

This is the second PREVIEW RELEASE for the tree branch. It is *NOT* part of
i3?s regular releases and should *NOT* be packaged in the usual way for
distributions.  Instead, provide a separate, unofficial package if possible.

The so called tree branch is the place where the next version of i3 is
developed. This time, we did a major code refactoring bringing many changes.
The idea is to use a tree as datastructure instead of separate lists (like one
for outputs, workspaces and a table for storing your window layout).

Quite a few advantages arise from this new data structure. The most prominent
ones will be a slightly different look and feel, the possibility to store your
layout and restore it later, correct resizing, a much cleaner command parser
and more little improvements.

As this is a preview release, some things are not working yet. Generally,
though, the core developers are using it already and think it?s good enough to
try it out. With this release, we want to gather feedback from you, so please
report any bugs you encounter in our bugtracker at http://i3.zekjur.net/bugs

What should be working in this release?
---------------------------------------

 ? Basic window management, navigation, moving
 ? Fullscreen mode, correct aspect ratio
 ? Stacked/Tabbed layout, floating mode
 ? Splitting (for fancy layouts), resizing
 ? Restarts (preserving the layout), crash handler
 ? RandR changes, keyboard layout changes
 ? Dock clients
 ? i3bar, get it from http://git.merovius.de/

If any of these features do not work (correctly), please file a bugreport.

What is not working in this release?
------------------------------------

 ? Assignments
 ? Configfile compatibility

Subject: [i3 announcement] i3lock 2.1 released
Message-ID: <1300045674-sup-8262@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

I just released i3lock 2.1.

i3lock is a simple (but improved) screen locker, like slock. You start it, your
screen gets blanked (or an image will be displayed) and stays like this until
you enter your password.

Changes since version 2.0 are:
 ? Accept return/backspace when the buffer of 512 bytes is full
 ? Handle numpad keys correctly
 ? Handle MappingNotify events
 ? Correctly check for errors when connecting to X11
 ? Add i3lock.pam to not rely on debian?s /etc/pam.d/other anymore
 ? don?t display debug output
 ? add NOLIBCAIRO flag to permit compilation without cairo

Get it from http://i3.zekjur.net/i3lock/i3lock-2.1.tar.gz
?and verify the GPG signature:
http://i3.zekjur.net/i3lock/i3lock-2.1.tar.gz.asc

Best regards,
Michael

BTW: As always, the new version is already on its way to Debian.
