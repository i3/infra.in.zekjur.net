Subject: [i3 announcement] i3lock 2.4.1 released
Message-ID: <20120602143535.20820.98654@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,
  
a few minutes ago, I released version 2.4.1 of i3lock.

i3lock is a simple (but improved) screen locker, like slock. You start it, your
screen gets blanked (or an image will be displayed) and stays like this until
you enter your password.

Changelog for this release:
 ? Bugfix: Correctly center unlock indicator after reconfiguring screens
   (Thanks xeen)
 ? Bugfix: Revert shift lock handling (broke uppercase letters)
 ? Bugfix: Skip shift when getting the modifier mask (Thanks SardemFF7)

Get it from?

?and verify the GPG signature:

Best regards,
Michael

BTW: For the debian users, a new version has been uploaded and will be
available soon.
