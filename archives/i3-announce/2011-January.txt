Hi,

I just released i3 v3.?-bf2. Upgrading to this release is recommended to all
users. The release contains only bugfixes and is considered stable.

Here are the release notes:

Release notes for i3 v3.?-bf2
-----------------------------

This is the second bugfix release (bf2) for version 3.? of i3. Current
development focuses on the tree branch which contains a major refactoring.
Because (as usual) there are still bugs in the stable versions, though, we
felt it was a good idea to have this bugfix release.

This release contains only bugfixes and is considered stable.

All users of older versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.

Thanks for this release go out to fernandotcl, Marcus, Stefan, dbp, quaec.
