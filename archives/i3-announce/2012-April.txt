Subject: [i3 announcement] i3lock 2.4 released
Message-ID: <1333280158-sup-8611@stapelberg.de>

Hi,
  
a few minutes ago, I released version 2.4 of i3lock.
  
i3lock is a simple (but improved) screen locker, like slock. You start it, your
screen gets blanked (or an image will be displayed) and stays like this until
you enter your password.

Changelog for this release:
 ? Bugfix: Fix background color when using cairo (Thanks Pascal)
 ? Only output text when in debug mode (fixes problems with xautolock)
 ? fallback when the image cannot be loaded
 ? Use (void) instead of () for functions without args (Thanks fernandotcl)

Get it from?
http://i3wm.org/i3lock/i3lock-2.4.tar.bz2
?and verify the GPG signature:
http://i3wm.org/i3lock/i3lock-2.4.tar.bz2.asc

Best regards,
Michael

BTW: For the debian users, a new version has been uploaded and will be
available soon.

Subject: [i3 announcement] i3 v4.2 released
Message-ID: <20120425214336.9230.95598@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

I just released i3 v4.2. The changes follow:

 ????????????????????????????????
 ? Release notes for i3 v4.2    ?
 ????????????????????????????????

This is the second release of the new major version of i3, v4.2. It is
considered stable. All users of i3 are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

A big change with this release is (again) a new parser for commands. You might
get the impression that we like rewriting parsers, but check the commit message
of commit a532f5a for rationale on this decision.

A more visible change to users is the introduction of a scratchpad command:
This is useful to have a permanent editor session ready whenever you need it.
Or your music player. Or email client? Or $programming-language REPL? Give it a
try!

Also, you are finally able to move workspaces between the different outputs if
you are using multiple monitors. You can rename workspaces on the fly and
identify named workspaces by their number. So you can rename "1: www" to "1:
code" with one simple rename command and all your keybindings will still work.

A subtle indicator of the split state of containers has been introduced: In
case you are in a split container with precisely one window (a situation which
you could not recognize by looking at your screen previously), i3 will
highlight the bottom/right border of the split container in a lighter blue.
This should reduce confusion about whether you are dealing with a split
container or not.

And finally, i3bar now supports a JSON input protocol, so that with a
subsequent release of i3status, you will be able to use colors in your bar!
