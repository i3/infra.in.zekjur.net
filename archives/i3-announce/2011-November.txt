Subject: [i3 announcement] i3lock 2.2 released
Message-ID: <1320590154-sup-8499@stapelberg.de>

Hi,

a few minutes ago, I released version 2.2 of i3lock.

i3lock is a simple (but improved) screen locker, like slock. You start it, your
screen gets blanked (or an image will be displayed) and stays like this until
you enter your password.

Changelog for this release:
 ? Don?t re-grab pointer/keyboard on MappingNotify. In some rare situations,
   this lead to some keypresses "slipping through" to the last focused window.
 ? Correctly handle Mode_switch/ISO_Level3_Shift
 ? Render to a pixmap which is used as background for the window instead of
   copying contents on every expose event
 ? Handle screen resolution changes while screen is locked
 ? Manpage: document arguments for every option

Get it from?
http://i3wm.org/i3lock/i3lock-2.2.tar.bz2
?and verify the GPG signature:
http://i3wm.org/i3lock/i3lock-2.2.tar.bz2.asc

Best regards,
Michael

BTW: For the debian users, a new version has been uploaded and will be
available soon.

Subject: [i3 announcement] i3 v4.1 released
Message-ID: <1321051906-sup-4074@stapelberg.de>

Hi,

I just released i3 v4.1. The release notes follow:

 ??????????????????????????????
 ? Release notes for i3 v4.1  ?
 ??????????????????????????????

This is the second release of the new major version of i3, v4.1. It brings some
new (and long-awaited) features, the most prominent being tray support in i3bar
(for NetworkManager, Skype, etc.). 

The assign syntax has changed to support criteria now. Also, criteria support
regular expressions (using PCRE) now. Check the userguide for the new syntax.
i3-nagbar will automatically display a warning when you use the old syntax.

i3 now supports startup notifications, meaning that during an application
starts up, the mouse cursor will change to 'watch' on the root window. Also,
the application window will appear on the workspace on which it was launched
(not on the currently focused workspace). Some applications don?t support
startup notifications. If the cursor change bothers you, turn it off by using
the --no-startup-id flag (see the userguide).

This release has been in use by many users and is considered stable. Please
upgrade.
