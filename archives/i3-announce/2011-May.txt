Hi,

A few minutes ago, I released i3 3.?-bf3. Here are the release notes:

This is the third bugfix release (bf3) for version 3.? of i3. Current
development focuses on the tree branch which contains a major refactoring.
Because  there are still bugs in the stable versions, though, we felt it was a
good idea to have this bugfix release.

This release contains only bugfixes and is considered stable.

All users of older versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.

Thanks for this release go out to fernandotcl, Merovius, Raphael, badboy,
David.

A list of changes follows:

 * Bugfix: Send WM_TAKE_FOCUS (fixes focus problems for Java apps)
 * Bugfix: Fix unaligned memory access on sparc
 * Bugfix: Fix possible rounding errors (when rounding up)
 * Make i3 compatible with latest xcb and yajl

Subject: [i3 announcement] i3 -tree *PREVIEW RELEASE 3*
Message-ID: <1306614003-sup-7069@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

(Also check http://i3wm.org/tree/ if you prefer websites).

I just released the third *PREVIEW RELEASE* of the i3 tree branch. Quote from
the release announcement:

This is the third PREVIEW RELEASE for the tree branch. It is *NOT* part of
i3?s regular releases and should *NOT* be packaged in the usual way for
distributions. Instead, provide a separate, unofficial package if possible.

The so called tree branch is the place where the next version of i3 is
developed. This time, we did a major code refactoring bringing many changes.
The idea is to use a tree as datastructure instead of separate lists (like one
for outputs, workspaces and a table for storing your window layout).

Quite a few advantages arise from this new data structure. The most prominent
ones will be a slightly different look and feel, the possibility to store your
layout and restore it later, correct resizing, a much cleaner command parser
and more little improvements.

As this is a preview release, some things are not working yet. Generally,
though, the core developers are using it already and think it?s good enough to
try it out. With this release, we want to gather feedback from you, so please
report any bugs you encounter in our bugtracker at http://bugs.i3wm.org/

What should be working in this release?
---------------------------------------

 ? Basic window management, navigation, moving
 ? Fullscreen mode, correct aspect ratio
 ? Stacked/Tabbed layout, floating mode
 ? Splitting (for fancy layouts), resizing
 ? Restarts (preserving the layout), crash handler
 ? RandR changes, keyboard layout changes
 ? Dock clients
 ? Assignments
 ? i3bar, get it from http://git.merovius.de/

If any of these features do not work (correctly), please file a bugreport.

What is not working in this release?
------------------------------------

 ? Configfile compatibility
