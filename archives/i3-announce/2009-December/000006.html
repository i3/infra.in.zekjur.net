<PRE>Hi,

a few minutes ago, i3 v3.&#948;-bf1 was released. An upgrade to this version is
recommended to any user running v3.&#948; or older.

Here are the release notes for this version:

This is the first bugfix release (bf1) for version 3.&#948; (transcribed 3.d) of
i3. Because many bugs were fixed after the release of version 3.&#948;, we thought
users of the stable releases might profit from this additional bugfix release.

Thanks for this release go out to msi, merovius, Grauwolf, jace, Syntropy,
Mirko, helgiks and Moredread.

A list of changes follows:

  * Bugfix: Don&#8217;t draw window title when titlebar is disabled
  * Bugfix: Correctly switch border types for floating windows
  * Bugfix: Correctly replay pointer if the click handler does not trigger
  * Bugfix: Also allow WORDs as workspace names
  * Bugfix: Correctly clear the urgency hint if a window gets unmapped without
    clearing it
  * Bugfix: Fix resizing of floating windows in borderless/1-px-border mode
  * Bugfix: Accept underscores in bindsym
  * Bugfix: Don&#8217;t set the urgency flag if the window is focused
  * Bugfix: Handle stack-limit cols on tabbed containers
  * Bugfix: Resize client after updating base_width/base_height
  * Bugfix: Force render containers after setting the client active
  * Bugfix: Fix two problems in resizing floating windows with right mouse
  * Bugfix: Use more precise floating point arithmetics
  * Bugfix: Correctly place new windows below fullscreen windows
