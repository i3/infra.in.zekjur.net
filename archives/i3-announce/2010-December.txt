Subject: [i3 announcement] i3 -tree *PREVIEW RELEASE*
Message-ID: <1291638528-sup-3134@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

(Also check http://i3.zekjur.net/tree/ if you prefer websites).

I just released the first *PREVIEW RELEASE* of the i3 tree branch. Quote from
the release announcement:

This is a PREVIEW RELEASE for the tree branch. It is *NOT* part of i3?s regular
releases and should *NOT* be packaged in the usual way for distributions.
Instead, provide a separate, unofficial package if possible.

The so called tree branch is the place where the next version of i3 is
developed. This time, we did a major code refactoring bringing many changes.
The idea is to use a tree as datastructure instead of separate lists (like one
for outputs, workspaces and a table for storing your window layout).

Quite a few advantages arise from this new data structure. The most prominent
ones will be a slightly different look and feel, the possibility to store your
layout and restore it later, correct resizing, a much cleaner command parser
and more little improvements.

As this is a preview release, some things are not working yet. Generally,
though, the core developers are using it already and think it?s good enough to
try it out. With this release, we want to gather feedback from you, so please
report any bugs you encounter in our bugtracker at http://i3.zekjur.net/bugs

What should be working in this release?
---------------------------------------

 ? Basic window management, navigation, moving
 ? Fullscreen mode, correct aspect ratio
 ? Stacked/Tabbed layout, floating mode
 ? Splitting (for fancy layouts), resizing
 ? Restarts, preserving the layout
 ? i3bar, get it from http://git.merovius.de/

If any of these features do not work (correctly), please file a bugreport.

What is not working in this release?
------------------------------------

 ? RandR changes (i3 needs to be restarted)
 ? Assignments
 ? Configfile compatibility
 ? Workspace switching is sometimes not working. If you find a pattern, please
   report it.
 ? There are still some bugs in resizing. Please report!
