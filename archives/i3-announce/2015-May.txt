Hi,

I just released i3lock 2.7, see http://i3wm.org/i3lock/. The changelog
follows:

 • Die when the X11 connection breaks during runtime (Thanks Eduan)
 • Implement logging the number of failed attempts (Thanks koebi)
 • Ignore password validation is pam is in wrong state (Thanks Neodyblue)
 • Get current user with getpwuid() instead of using $ENV{USER} (Thanks
Martin)
 • Add support for Compose and dead-keys with libxkbcommon.
   Requires libxkbcommon ≥ 0.5.0 (Thanks Daniel)
 • Format the source using clang-format.
 • Refresh pam credentials on successful authentication (for Kerberos and
the
   like) (Thanks James)
 • List pressed modifiers on failed authentication (Thanks Deiz, Alexandre)
 • Only redraw the screen if the unlock indicator is actually used
   (Thanks Ingo)
 • Make pkg-config configurable for cross-compilation (Thanks Nikolay)

Best regards,
Michael
