Subject: [i3 announcement] i3lock 2.3 released
Message-ID: <1331815345-sup-5901@stapelberg.de>

Hi,

a few minutes ago, I released version 2.3 of i3lock.

i3lock is a simple (but improved) screen locker, like slock. You start it, your
screen gets blanked (or an image will be displayed) and stays like this until
you enter your password.

Changelog for this release:
 ? Implement a visual unlock indicator
 ? Support ISO_Level5_Shift and Caps Lock
 ? Lock the password buffer in memory, clear it in RAM after verifying
 ? Fork after the window is visible, not before
 ? Bugfix: Copy the color depth from parent (root) window instead of
   hardcoding a depth of 24

Get it from?
http://i3wm.org/i3lock/i3lock-2.3.tar.bz2
?and verify the GPG signature:

Best regards,
Michael

BTW: For the debian users, a new version has been uploaded and will be
available soon.

I just pushed 2.3.1, which fixes a build problem on some systems.

Best regards,
