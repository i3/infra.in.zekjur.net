<PRE>Hi,

(Also check <A HREF="http://i3wm.org/tree/">http://i3wm.org/tree/</A> if you prefer websites).

I just released the third *PREVIEW RELEASE* of the i3 tree branch. Quote from
the release announcement:

This is the third PREVIEW RELEASE for the tree branch. It is *NOT* part of
i3&#8217;s regular releases and should *NOT* be packaged in the usual way for
distributions. Instead, provide a separate, unofficial package if possible.

The so called tree branch is the place where the next version of i3 is
developed. This time, we did a major code refactoring bringing many changes.
The idea is to use a tree as datastructure instead of separate lists (like one
for outputs, workspaces and a table for storing your window layout).

Quite a few advantages arise from this new data structure. The most prominent
ones will be a slightly different look and feel, the possibility to store your
layout and restore it later, correct resizing, a much cleaner command parser
and more little improvements.

As this is a preview release, some things are not working yet. Generally,
though, the core developers are using it already and think it&#8217;s good enough to
try it out. With this release, we want to gather feedback from you, so please
report any bugs you encounter in our bugtracker at <A HREF="http://bugs.i3wm.org/">http://bugs.i3wm.org/</A>

What should be working in this release?
---------------------------------------

 &#8226; Basic window management, navigation, moving
 &#8226; Fullscreen mode, correct aspect ratio
 &#8226; Stacked/Tabbed layout, floating mode
 &#8226; Splitting (for fancy layouts), resizing
 &#8226; Restarts (preserving the layout), crash handler
 &#8226; RandR changes, keyboard layout changes
 &#8226; Dock clients
 &#8226; Assignments
 &#8226; i3bar, get it from <A HREF="http://git.merovius.de/">http://git.merovius.de/</A>

If any of these features do not work (correctly), please file a bugreport.

What is not working in this release?
------------------------------------

 &#8226; Configfile compatibility
