Subject: [i3 announcement] i3lock 2.5 released
Message-ID: <x6a9mz1u2m.fsf@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

i3lock 2.5 was just released. It requires libxkbcommon ? 0.2.0, but in
turn does much better input handling.

Here is the changelog:

 ? NEW DEPENDENCY: Use libxkbcommon for input handling
   This makes input handling much better for many edge cases.
 ? Bugfix: fix argument parsing on ARM (s/char/int/)
 ? Bugfix: free(reply) to avoid memory leak
 ? Bugfix: Use ev_loop_fork after fork, fixes forking on kqueue based OSes
 ? Bugfix: Fix centering the indicator in the no-xinerama case
 ? Only use mlock() on Linux, FreeBSD (for example) requires root
 ? promote the "could not load image" message from debug to normal
 ? s/pam_message/pam_response/ (Thanks Tucos)
 ? remove support for NOLIBCAIRO, cairo-xcb is widespread by now
 ? Allow XKB_KEY_XF86ScreenSaver as synonym for enter
   This keysym is generated on convertible tablets by pressing a hardware
   lock/unlock button.
 ? Allow passwordless PAM conversations (e.g. fingerprint)
 ? Add ctrl+u password reset
 ? Set window name to i3lock

Best regards,
Michael
