Hi everyone,

i3status version 2.0 has just been released. It is considered stable and every
user should upgrade. The list of changes since version 1.2 follows:

 * add support for disk info (free/used/ins)
 * add support for displaying the ESSID of the wireless interface
 * add support for getting the public IPv6 address of the system
 * all "modules" now support format strings
 * switch to libconfuse for parsing the config file
 * merge support for FreeBSD for many "modules"
 * drop support for wmii, add support for xmobar

Best regards,
Michael
