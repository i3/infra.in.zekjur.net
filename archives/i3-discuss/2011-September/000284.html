<PRE>Hi Henryk,

Sorry I did not reply earlier.

Excerpts from Henryk Hecht's message of 2011-08-28 03:50:28 +0200:
&gt;<i> I discovered i3 a day or so ago, and have a number of questions that don't 
</I>&gt;<i> seem to be covered in the documentation.  I don't know if the readers of 
</I>&gt;<i> the list would prefer one email per question or otherwise, so I'll just 
</I>&gt;<i> start with the most immediate:
</I>Yes, please post one email per question. If you want to, you could also come to
IRC and get a more rapid response (hopefully) :).

&gt;<i> i3-input accepts a -p argument as a prefix to a command, but does not seem 
</I>&gt;<i> to allow one to have a suffix to what is read; is this correct?  The 
</I>&gt;<i> motivation is to build a goto-by-class binding:
</I>&gt;<i> i3-input -p '[class=' -P 'Goto :' '] focus'
</I>Yeah, the goto command was just 'goto' in previous versions (and I think of
re-introducing an alias), so that was never an issue there ;).

&gt;<i> but it seems that it ignores anything in argv not in the getopt loop, 
</I>&gt;<i> leaving no way to build a command where the &quot;interesting&quot; part does not 
</I>&gt;<i> occur at the end.  An equivalent example is found in section 5.7 of the 
</I>&gt;<i> user guide (&quot;VIM-like marks (mark/goto)&quot;): there appears to be no way to 
</I>&gt;<i> actually implement this functionality with i3-input, which is recommended 
</I>&gt;<i> for the task.  One could, of course, enter the whole command with 
</I>&gt;<i> i3-input, or just append &quot;] focus&quot; oneself, but this seems unnecessarily 
</I>&gt;<i> tedious: hardly a timesaver.
</I>Yep.

&gt;<i> Is it better to just ignore i3-input and write a shell script around 
</I>&gt;<i> i3-msg and xdialog?
</I>The best way of course would be to fix i3-input, probably accepting a format
string and replacing %c for command.

For the readers of this mailing list, there is a ticket which includes a patch:
<A HREF="http://bugs.i3wm.org/ticket/512">http://bugs.i3wm.org/ticket/512</A>

Best regards,
Michael
