I didn't mean to imply that you're approach is unreasonable, only that it
does not seem to fit into the usage model and philosophy of i3. In such a
case, perhaps there is a more appropriate wm out there. Then again, as you
say, perhaps not.

That said, I am just as interested in how you are interfacing, given that
you like i3 but would seem to like it to be more mouse-centric, as I am in
the research that Michael mentioned earlier. I for one do not believe in
there being 'only one way to do it' for HID and am always curious about
encountering new diversity.



&gt;<i> So I will stick to i3 + patches :)
</I>&gt;<i>

Please consider sharing your patches back out to the community. I certainly
wasn't intending to engage in flaming in any way, and I don't think
flamewars will erupt if you publish you patches.
