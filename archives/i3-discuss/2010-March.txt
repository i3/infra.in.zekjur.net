Subject: [i3] i3 next branch
Message-ID: <8e04b5821003032225s67c86eddh9fc5c0a9eff57cb1@mail.gmail.com>

    Hello all!

    Today I've looked upon the i3 next branch and I see that it has
advanced very much than the master branch. Now my understanding is
that the master branch is somehow stable and thus usable by
non-i3-developers (the releases are cropped from this), and the next
branch is for development purposes.

    So my questions are:
    * what is your policy about the master branch? when do you advance
it? (I see a lot of bug fixes in the next branch that could be helpful
in the master);
    * is the next branch stable usable enough to be used in real-life?
(if so I would use it and thus maybe provide bug-reports;)

    Thanks,
    Ciprian.

Hi Ciprian,

Excerpts from Ciprian Dorin, Craciun's message of Do M?r 04 07:25:38 +0100 2010:

The master branch contains the last release plus any bugfixes which are
appropriate to backport. If a commit is not strictly a bugfix (but rather
an improvement in usability) or if it is a bugfix for a bug which only
exists in "next", it does not get backported.

>     * is the next branch stable usable enough to be used in real-life?

I use the next branch all the time and as long as you do not have any
really critical work to do (like your company goes bankrupt if this window
is closed in the wrong moment), I would recommend you to use it and report
any bugs you see.

Best regards,
Michael

    Aha. Thanks! I'll build and install the next branch, and if there
are problems I'll write!

    Keep up the good work!

Subject: [i3] Problem with dock windows and libxcb-icccm
Message-ID: <20100310105539.GA20698@cl0311500093650>


Hi all,

There's a problem with dock windows under i3.

These type of windows have xcb_get_property_value_length(reply) = 0,
while all other windows have 72.

This causes a floating-point exception in the
xcb_get_wm_size_hints_from_reply function, making i3 crash.

This is reproducible by launching:

$ while true ; do date && sleep 1 ; done | dzen2 -dock -ta r

This command always makes i3 crash under OpenBSD 4.7 (OpenBSD -current),
which is my test system, but I had occasional crashes under linux too
(up-to-date Arch Linux).

I suggest this patch:


diff --git a/icccm/icccm.c b/icccm/icccm.c
index 0206e4b..b86f4e1 100644
--- a/icccm/icccm.c
+++ b/icccm/icccm.c

+  if(!reply || xcb_get_property_value_length(reply) == 0)
     return 0;
 
   int length = xcb_get_property_value_length(reply) / (reply->format / 8);


I'd like to have some feedback on this...

Presumably, because the property isn't present on those windows, which
would mean the type is None and the format, bytes-after, and length
are all zero.

Surely it isn't the length being 0, but rather the format, that causes
this error.

Since the immediately following if-condition tests that the type and
format are sane, I'd suggest splitting off the length >= 15 portion of
the test into its own if-statement and moving the length computation
in between the two tests.

Michael's right that there's been a similar fix before, but I think
Debian bug 531310 is unrelated. Commit
d5b5d682465bd3196105df86d6df9fcde9518e6c looks like it addressed a
similar issue though, in a different function. This code apparently
needs an audit for more bugs like these.

Hi Michael,
thanks for your reply.

On OpenBSD we have libxcb 1.4 and xcb-util 0.3.6, but latter is patched 
to fix the problems highligthed here:

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xcb/util/commit/?id=d5b5d682465bd3196105df86d6df9fcde9518e6c

http://archive.netbsd.se/view_attachment.php?id=12115870.183264

This is the commit:

http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/xenocara/dist/xcb-util/icccm/icccm.c.diff?r1=1.4;r2=1.5


Can this new bug be due to stricter checks in OpenBSD's libc?

cheers,
david

Yes! I was wrong... reply->format is also zero:

03/10/2010 01:06:46 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_windowclass_change:710 - WM_CLASS changed to dzen2 (instance), dzen (class)
03/10/2010 01:06:46 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_windowname_change_legacy:649 - WM_NAME changed to "dzen title"
03/10/2010 01:06:46 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_windowname_change_legacy:660 - Using legacy window title. Note that in order to get Unicode window titles in i3, the application has to set _NET_WM_NAME which is in UTF-8 encoding.
03/10/2010 01:06:46 PM - src/handlers.c:handle_normal_hints:840 - Window: frame 0x0040000a, child 0x00a00005
DEBUG1: xcb_get_property_value_length(reply) = 0
DEBUG2: reply->format = 0

So it's a division by zero error obviously raising a SIGFPE.


ciao,
david

Hi,

I  had  a  quick  look  at  the  code  and  found  a  similar  issue  in
xcb_get_text_property_reply(), despite being  less important, it is also
clearly   a   bug   because    if   the   property   is   not   present,
xcb_get_text_property_reply() would happily returns 1.

The patch is available there (indeed Xlib performs the same check...):
http://www.mini-dweeb.org/~arnau/coding/patches/0001-The-reply-type-could-be-XCB_NONE-if-the-property-is-.patch

I  will commit it  to the  xcb/util Git  repository if  nobody complains
about it ;).

Cheers,
Arnaud

Message-ID: <g2vbaf45701003270133z9657d659m24bdf0cfae8f269c@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

So my work machine needed to be reinstalled as RHEL 5.4, from Fedora 12.

 I've downloaded and compiled xcb and also the 'next' branch of i3.   When I
start i3 at login, it seg faults.

I'm not very familiar with the code, so I'm sending the info into the
mailing list in hopes that someone can better help.

Here's the backtrace:

#0  0x0805d4a8 in reparent_window (conn=0x97c3bd8, child=2097190,

Please let me know if there is anything else I should gather or try. I would
love to be able to use my blessed i3 on my workstation.

Scott

Can you please post the full logfile when starting with maximum debug level
(flags are -V -d all)? Also, please use 'backtrace full' instead of 'backtrace'
when posting backtraces. My guess is that CUR_CELL is NULL for some reason.
Maybe an error when initializing your screens, so the logfile is even more
interesting.

Best regards,
Michael

Hi,

I plan to release i3 3.? on tuesday or wednesday unless some important
major bug comes up. To ensure that there you will not run in such a bug
when 3.? is released, you can check out the git "next" branch and test it,
here comes how:

  git clone git://code.stapelberg.de/i3 -b next
  cd i3 && make -j4 && sudo make install

(note that you might need libyajl and libxcb-randr as new dependencies)
(also make sure to read docs/multi-monitor if you are using the nVidia
binary driver)

To verify that you are running the latest version, check your logfile
and see something like 3.d-246-ga6d22f0 (2010-03-27), meaning that you
are 246 commits after the release of 3.?.

Any testing is much appreciated!

Best regards,
Michael

PS: If you run into problems or have questions, the IRC channel is the
best place to discuss it.
