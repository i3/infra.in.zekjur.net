Subject: [i3] i3 and i3bar config
Message-ID: <34538.194.197.79.18.1328085914.squirrel@lavabit.com>

I've just recently tried i3 at work, and was trying to make tray work
(unfortunately it is not preconfigured by default, which I find strange)
I added the necessary lines to ~/.i3/config for tray to work on boot at
the end of config file, but after gdm login i3 crashes and I'm taken back
to login screen. This is what I added:

bar {
    output            LVDS1
    status_command    i3status
    position          top
    mode              hide
    workspace_buttons yes
    tray_output       HDMI1

    font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1

    colors {
        background #000000
        statusline #ffffff

        focused_workspace  #ffffff #285577
        active_workspace   #ffffff #333333
        inactive_workspace #888888 #222222
        urgent_workspace   #ffffff #900000
    }
}

Tell me what am I doing wrong?

Hi mountpeaks,

This sounds like you are using an old version of i3.

Please provide the output of i3 --version. If it?s older than 4.1, there is no
tray for you :).

Best regards,
Michael

Subject: [i3] Can I get the current mode?
Message-ID: <CAPAw0WrxBwVCsqv65Brh6u+rdCfwDkG2k4UWfDE7DjZps+rpLA@mail.gmail.com>

How can I get the current mode?  I am looking for the mode that is set
in the i3 config, i.e. mode "resize."  There are a couple of uses I
can think of; first, displaying it in the status bar; second, using it
within a script.

Thanks.

Hi All,

At first BIG thanks for authors for creating such an excellent product!

I would like to share my 1-week experience here, because I think it is relevant 
for authours to understand what/how novices think. My impressions
are fresh now, but the more I became used to, the less I will notice
the small but important differencies which novice users need.

What I explain is neigher critics, neither wishes to implement. It is as-is, 
just the impressions of new user, and please do your own judgement
and conclusions if anything from said below is important for you
and strategically for i3.

Things I've noticed:

1) There are no good explation of stacking mode in the video screencast
     and docs.

2) "Resize" section of default config file is too complicated. I've come
     with much better solution for me, it is very easy to remember:

# resize
bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Left            resize shrink   right 3 px or 3 ppt
bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Right           resize grow     right 3 px or 3 ppt
bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Right   resize shrink   left 3 px or 3 ppt
bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Left    resize grow     left 3 px or 3 ppt
bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Up              resize shrink   down 3 px or 3 ppt
bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Down            resize grow     down 3 px or 3 ppt
bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Down    resize shrink   up 3 px or 3 ppt
bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Up      resize grow     up 3 px or 3 ppt

P.S. May be I just don't get the defaule resize mode. I've tried
it a few times and later just disabled it because were unable to learn
it fast.

3) [minor issue ]Modkey + jkl - difficult to re-learn after xmonad,
     awesome and others which have assigned different meanings for those keys
     by default

4) [minor] I can not find the shortcut for Alt-Tab. Simple, this should be 
ability
     to cycle windows on current desktop. Most of newcoming users would feel
     bad without it.

5) [minor] Floating mode for the whole desktop. Let me explain. Tiling & 
stacking
     are very good for hard work, where all space is occupied
     by different windows. But there are situations when I don't need
     this. Sometimes I want to see my nice background and a few floating
     windows over it. It would be good to have such a mode for desktop,
     as a fallback for a typical user to normal work.

     The other argument: I use to put very nice background on my desktop,
     and would never see it if I always work in tiling.

     It is also _very_ important IMO if we would ever have floating
     mode for desktop, it should support 'smart' window placement. I've
     explained
     what I mean in this video: http://youtu.be/eS-mchtzJsg but generally it
     means
     the following: place window in biggest onuccupied space on current screen.

6) *Always* pressing Modkey+H, Modkey+V before every next program open is
     overkill. I think more smart would be to cycle this. Why? Because now every
     next window open always have bigger ratio X*Y where it is comfortable to
     work
     with apps in square. So, what I mean, exactly, I think it would be helpful
     if:
       6.1. Mod+enter - opens terminal on full screen
       6.2. Mod+enter - opens terminal split vertically
       6.3. Mod+enter (without Modkey+v) opens new terminal split horizontally

etc... Because I always tend to do it this way. I don't see big necessity
to open tall narrow terminals.

     6.4. Next one should open horizontally.

Looks like we come up to somehow called 'spiral' layout, but its smarter 
because
when you switch to other window, it would continue splitting this way.

7) Its very pity that dmenu does not remember previous choice. It would be 
great
to improve this part of dmenu.

8) Until there are serious bugs remain, like dying tray applications (
http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/550) it would be diffcult to advertize
i3. I am upset that such great window manager still don't get great
public attention (like I don't see it in Google Trends), but may be its not a 
right time. When everything will be very stable, I will try publish an article 
about it in habr (21523 readers) for russian speaking ppl.

Again, please don't treat this as critics, no way! You have created
one of the greatest products around, and I hope that my first impressions
will tell you something about new users mind :)

Best Regards,

        I found the documentation pretty easy to follow and understand, 
        but then again never used stacking mode.

        I also come from 3 years of using xmonad, but the ModKey+jkl;?
        is there as well enabled by default (see bellow).

        You can cycle windows wih ``vi'' like bindings. 
        The only thing which is weird is because ModKey+h is bind 
        to horiz split.

        Maybe here we can enable a default ``vi'' window splitting as
        well ? (binding ModKey+s for horiz and ModKey+v for vertical 
        -- though I think I had to replace other modifier as it was
        already taken).

        This the key word here is default configuration, by default
        I mean the simplest configuration file you can have -- if
        for instance I delete my configuration file, i3 should
        assume implicit values as explained in the manual.

        +1, at first was pressing this pretty intensive, it seems I
        never realized until ``now'' how much I used that.

        I think floating should be ``enabled'' before window/container 
        creation -- let's say I want this workspace to have floating 
        mode switch to that then all windows in that workspace can be
        smartly sized placed.

        I also vote on this, but I have to say that after some
        time, I find it more normal/natural this way, as you arrange 
        your layout as you may seem fit -- but of course having a
        default ``smart'' spiral layout sounds great, the issue for
        me here would be to keep this layout after windows/containers
        are destroyed not having to do it all over again.

        You have consistent behaviour which we humans seem to value

        Never had this issue, and it seems stable enough to go
        from a 3 year xmonad productive configuration in just
        a day pretty nice.

I am personally totally against this. The arrangement of the layout is a 
personal choice, and e.g. I do it completely different. I also do not 
find it that that hard to press the modifier I want, before opening the 
next program.

Nice to read, what other users are thinking, thx. I remember my first
week with i3. I never use a tiling WM before and know I can't without.

Same here. I skip entering resize mode, and do it directly like you.

I use Alt-Tab in this way and I like it.

  ## switching workspace
  bindsym Mod1+Tab workspace back_and_forth

But I agree, sometimes it would be nice to switch between the last two
windows.

Nice to have, but I don't need it really.

I wouldn't like it. I want *my* layout and *no* rule. ;-) I have no
problem with hitting ?mod-v to put the third terminal under the second.
For more complex layouts shell scripts can do a good job.

Section 2.2 mentions the stacking layout:

http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_the_container_layout

Perhaps it could be expanded. If you think you can improve it, please
let us know, submit patches, etc.

Resizing with the keyboard is complicated. We have some ideas to
provide simpler resizing with the keyboard in the bugtracker:

http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/576

We don't use 2-modifier bindings in the default config. I'm guessing
here, but I think there are two reasons for that. First, it would
probably complicate things. Second, we ask the user what modifier he'd
like to use in the config wizard, and thus using 2-modifier bindings
wouldn't make much sense.

Whether using 2-modifier bindings in the default config would make
things easier or not is completely subjective, and I don't see the
default bindings for resizing changing unless we introduce different
ways to resize. I could argue that the bindings I set up for my laptop
are clearly better, but that doesn't mean they should be the default
bindings. :-)

There's no such concept in i3, as focus follows the tree hierarchy.
Using any tiled window manager requires learning, unfortunately, and
i3 is no different. That said, if you're considering implementing
this, please ping Michael first to see if he would accept it.

That's probably not going to happen, as Michael already stated in the
past. i3 is a pure tiling window manager, floating exists mostly for
popups and compatibility with the occasional broken application.

The snapping behavior has been shot down already in the past:

http://infra.in.zekjur.net/pipermail/i3-discuss/2011-September/000286.html

Also, using the "beautiful desktop background" argument will get you
nowhere. i3 prioritizes functionality over form, and thus a point like
this is never going to be taken seriously. If you want to see a
beautiful image, use a image viewer or switch to an empty workspace.

Just some clarification. You only need to split before opening a
client *if* you want to split the current container. You could argue
that the spiral layout you're describing forces one to "unsplit"
before launching a client, which would be rather "unproductive" too if
that is not what you wanted to do, naturally.

What you describe is the Awesome spiral layout. i3, on the other hand,
works by making you manage the layout by splitting, resizing and
moving containers around in a tree structure. It's a different
behavior, I don't see that changing. In the future, you might be able
to restore from a previously-saved (or manually composed) layout. That
might be enough for your needs.

Yeah, as it's already been mentioned, dmenu is a separate project,
created and maintained by different people. Please ping them with
suggestions about dmenu (it's part of the Suckless project/community).

We are very aware of the bugs in i3 (after all, that's why we track
them in the bugtracker). If you can reproduce #550 (or any other bug
that needs attention), please post relevant information in the
bugtracker.

It would be nice if you or anyone wrote articles about i3, but I'd
suggest that you take your time adapting to how things work with i3
first.

Hi Fernando & All,

Yes, agree with above said by you. I am novice user, and posted only my
first week impressions, most of them could be unrelevant or misconcepts.

Example: making full support for floating would be 'nice to have' but...
I *do* understand that may add too much crap to the code, and probably 
authors are not interested in that at all at this stage, especially when 
its being very optional. So, please dont pay much attention to all what 
I've said. I only  mentioned it because I wanted to express 'general' 
feel, without paying atttention on how difficult (or conceptually) it 
would be to get it implemented.

Based on your comments vote for two things:

  1) Still I think it would be very good for the Alt-Tab support.

Let me explain my necessity in it:

Where I find it *very* useful that i3 does remember the active window
in the current container, I still will have to press more keys then
in other WM when I need to work between two windows located
on different sides of the screen:

For example I have a very big 27" panel, where I place
applications in 4 rows. Using cursor navigation between windows
would take longer, then using alt-tab to switch between last 2 used apps.
I am not very big fan of mouse, and try to use it only in this kind
of corner situations. It would help if I have only one screen (and for example
moving focus out of screen would go round to left side) but when there
are multiple big screens connected, focus would go there.

Cycle windows using Alt-Tab, based on history of last active window
would solve this easily, and less keypresses (or mouse movements)
will be needed.

  2) Smart container auto-split. That feature may be optional. Now,
I think I will stay with the following: after new app open, I *always* should
specify manually how the next application will split the current container.
Lets see if I can get this habit. Because what happens now is that a lot
of windows open (chat windows, etc) usaully in wrong direction, and I almost
always have to relocate or re-split the container and relocate window
back to correct location.

> It would be nice if you or anyone wrote articles about i3, but I'd

Yes, agree. Writing good article also requires good time. I hope to get
it done properly after a few more weeks by using this fantastic program!
Thank you and all above commented on my initial response :-)

I find the concept of alt-tab horrible. In its usual implementation (like it is
implemented in Windows, Mac OS X, GNOME, ?), it either requires you to remember
where focus was before, or you end up in the wrong window. Now, most of the
mentioned implementations also display some kind of window list to make this
more deterministic, but that requires additional hand-eye-coordination, which
i3 attempts to get rid of (mostly).

Therefore, I don?t want to have an alt-tab-like feature. Most users get used to
using the direction keys just fine.

Hm, I usually set my workspaces to stacked layout (unless I?m using very big
monitors) and then break out of that (by using focus parent and opening a new
window) when necessary. For more advanced rules, like splitting based on the
amount of windows / space used, I would recommend writing external scripts, but
I?m not quite sure how exactly that could be done from the top of my head :).

If we forgot to reply to any of your points, please let us know. The list was
pretty long :).

Best regards,
Michael

The best alt-tab implementation along all the WMs was here:
http://fluxbox-wiki.org/index.php/Keyboard_shortcuts
0 or unspecified = Default/current behavior - no skipping
1 cycle groups
2 skip stuck windows
4 skip shaded windows
8 cycle linear (use the same order every time)

Of course bitmasks would have different meanings for i3 (like insetad of 
cycle windows we would cycle history or cycle linear), but the general
idea behind that is that end user configure what he thinks is more 
appropriate.

No problem, I will use it as-is anyway. Well, that is a minor issue ;-)

Yah, for one week experience I am not yet started with scripting here, 
probably this will start after at least a few months, and only if I find
that I am missing something important.

Thank you & have a good day!

Subject: [i3] Starting applications on specific workspaces
Message-ID: <CAB-gU_tkGLRZMYd+HHwdnF0MpghoZtjT0f_jdqJOi97oOj_zyQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to get a certain behavior out of I3. As an example, lets say I'd
like to have a firefox browser window on workspace 3, a chromium browser
window on workspace 9 , etc.  * However, I do not want to launch another
firefox again and have it also appear on workspace 3 *.

For some reason, each firefox has the same WM_CLASS class / instance fields
on my debian system. Too bad they didn't append natural numbers to each
instance: firefox1 for the first, firefox2 for the second , etc. This is
not a problem with some of the terminal emulator's  e.g. gnome-terminal
lets you set the WM_NAME window name, it remains static,  and we can assign
to that. I tried using exec xprop -name ..... -set name .....  to set the
window name for the browsers from the config file, but i get no such
window. I believe this is because the window name changes, as mentioned in
the user guide.

 I can think of two ways to get my desired behavior to work. One  would be
a on_workspace command which I would add to the config file and its
signature would be "on_workspace 9 exec chromium" or something similar,
with the expected behavior launching a chromium browser on workspace 9.
Another way would be to change the exec command to pass back the window id,
however I'm not sure this is possible, and it doesn't seem to go with the
design plan for i3.  Can anybody suggest a way to achieve the behavior I'm
looking for, or give me a pointer on how to implement the feature myself?

The solution for this is:

i3-msg workspace 3; i3-msg exec firefox
i3-msg workspace 9; i3-msg exec chromium

?assuming that both browsers are startup-notification compatible and you are
using i3 v4.1 or newer. At least chromium is definitely startup-notification
compatible.

for the response. I was looking at i3-msg but it wasn't clear to me how to
use it. Thanks for elucidating that for me. I'll have a look at the thought

You could use a IRC client without X like irssi or weechat to stay on
IRC while working on your i3 setup.

First, just a note to endorse the recent appreciative posts about i3.
I've been trying out tiling WMs for the last 3 months, especially xmonad
and dwm. I liked both but with reservations; I find that i3 gives me
pretty much everything I was looking for, so many thanks to the
developers. I've discussed it on my blog and it gets quite a few hits.

Just one minor query about the internal status bar. What is the meaning
of the figure immediately to the left of the date? It currently reads
0.00 but at times other figures appear, and gradually decline towards
zero. I can't see any documentation about this bar anywhere.

This is your system load :) If you use "top" you can see "load average"
with three values which display the average load over a specific time.
The default is 1, 5 and 15 minutes. You should also see this in your
.i3status.conf.
At least i guess that is what you mean.

Thank you, yes; I'd guessed it was that but wasn't sure. And thanks for
the pointer to i3statsus.conf, which I'd missed.

Subject: [i3] i3-py, a Python module for communicating with i3
Message-ID: <CAC_712punBWGY4T=2AUPrcvdYf930T3mveRL=2aScF1JfTUyWw@mail.gmail.com>

I've implemented a Python module for communication with i3; it makes
communicating easy by doing socket stuff for the user and it also supports
subscribing to events with custom callbacks.

For example, the following Python code

import i3
i3.layout('tabbed')

changes the layout of the current workspace.

The user can still work with sockets and send messages to i3 as described
on the IPC interface page <http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html>, so it also works
as an i3-ipc library.
There's also an i3-ipc script, which is more or less just a clone of
i3-msg, and an i3wsbar implementation (still early in development though).

Source code is hosted at https://github.com/jzib/i3-py. The
README<https://github.com/jzib/i3-py/blob/master/README.md>contains
much more information about i3-py's features.

Criticism, feature requests, bug reports, contributions and insults are
welcome!

Subject: [i3] Request for CPU time
Message-ID: <1328554416-sup-890@stapelberg.de>

Hi,

Currently, the machine providing the autobuilder service is down. This is not a
huge deal (I can temporarily run the autobuilder on my notebook or something),
but I don?t like single point of failures and I have been looking to extend the
capacity of our autobuilder setup anyways.

So, if you want to help the i3 project, we need at least one machine with the
following specs:

 ? reasonably fast CPU (anything > 2 GHz will do)
 ? at least 10 GiB of disk space
 ? at least 2 GiB of RAM, 4 GiB preferred (to keep the whole build chroot in
   RAM and have very fast builds)
 ? fast internet connection preferred (to upload ~ 10 MiB per git commit, so
   quite low-traffic)
 ? amd64 linux installation (so that we can build for i386 and amd64)

This can be a virtual machine or a physical machine, but it needs to be hosted
somewhere (that is, we are not looking for hardware donations).

Please contact me off-list if you can offer anything.

Thank you,
Best regards,
Michael

Seriously, Why no xft support?
I could found a lot of use cases for xft, like:
Outline fonts, hinting, sub-pixel font rendering which would be nice
for lcd display, support font alias so I could use different font for
different language, make font config easier, and many more.

So could anyone give me a reason why you decided not to include xft support?

I guess you reached that conclusion based on item 9 in the i3 home
page. Michael could probably give you specific reasons, but most
likely he simply likes his X core fonts and wouldn't want the burdern
of supporting different rendering engines. Now I've talked to Michael
about this in the past, and I think we might be able to support modern
rendering engines soon-ish.

Some time ago we made changes to the i3 source that moved font
rendering to libi3. Right now we can only render X core fonts with
this font rendering API, but I maintain a Pango backend (I can post
the patches somewhere if you want to give it a shot). When and if this
backend is merged, we'll have "xft" fonts in i3.

The major reason why this backend hasn't been merged so far is that i3
uses xcb, not Xlib (well, except for a few things) and we use Pango to
render on top of a Cairo surface connected to a xcb pixmap. Cairo
doesn't officially support xcb, so not all distros ship xcb support
for Cairo (Debian does, Arch doesn't). This is probably gonna change
when the next release of Cairo is out (1.12, if I'm not mistaken). By
then we can consider integrating this backend or not.

To clarify, Pango support would automagically bring us (in i3, i3bar
and other tools):

* UTF-8 support
* Support for right-to-left languages
* Smooth fonts, with hinting, sub-pixel rendering, etc., as you mentioned

Pango support would *not* bring us "outlines", though. Although it
could perhaps be implemented with Pango, this would require theming
changes, and that would be a separate discussion.

2/2 only makes the i3bar text align with the workspace indicators
(might be used without the Pango patches too).

This is WIP, but it should work (I've been using it for some time
now). You'll need Pango and Cairo dev packages installed, of course,
and your distro must support the XCB backend for Cairo.

I'm running i3 with your patch now.
While i3 is working well with this patch, I notice some glitches.

The text's width seems to be mis-calculated, resulting in window title
being truncated even if the text string is far from filling the whole
title bar.
Another thing I notice is that the string seems to be truncated to a
'wrong' length, leaves some trailing, undisplayable characters.

These glitches mainly occur if non-english characters are involved.

Screenshots attached.

Can you post a screenshot of this specific problem? If the text width
were being miscalculated somehow (we use Pango itself to determine the
text width), it would be terminated with ellipsis.

I noticed that too, but I thought it was something with my fonts. Can
you confirm that it works with, say, Openbox (which also uses Pango
for rendering)?

I think it could be a bug in the UCS-2 -> UTF-8 conversion, I'll take
a look at it.

Fernando

Ah, I think I nailed it. Can you see if this fixes the issues you mentioned?

It also made me realize that draw_text isn't well documented... I'll work on it.

Subject: [i3] [PATCH] Improved i3bar hide mode behavior (In my point of view)
Message-ID: <CAMJW5=0hC+1YhuPyY8=eQtAKuM0VwzPgiGRDAwJs2aXzF_YcKw@mail.gmail.com>

When a workspace marked 'urgent', i3bar unhide itself. if I want to
hide it again, I must press the modifier.
This sometimes annoys me.

In this patch I change the above behavior to this: If a urgent
workspace occurs, i3bar will unhide itself; and when you navigates
away from the last urgent workspace and there is no more urgent
workspace, i3bar will hide itself again.

Oops... I messed it up.
Here is the patch fix build, and improve the behavior a little bit more:
When the urgent workspace is currently focused, i3bar will hide as
soon as the urgent mark has gone.

excellent, when this patch does, what you're saying it does, it fixes a
bug, that has bothered me from the beginning, but I never had the nerve
to fix ;)

Message-ID: <1330029068-20904-1-git-send-email-bebl@mageta.org>

Hi folks,

I noticed that there is currently no way to display memory-stats with i3status.
Because I like to know how much memory is used/free on my systems I wrote a
small addition to i3status to cover this.

The RFC only covers stats on linux-systems as I'm not that familiar with
FreeBSD.

I'm not entirely sure whether I covered everything necessary, or if there are
still bugs. But if you like it, you are free to use it/modify it as you please.

Best regards,
- Benjamin

Adds a new output which can be used to display common memory-statistics,
like top would do it.

The current implementation supports only linux and reads /proc/meminfo.

I believe we don't have memory stats in i3status because Michael
doesn't think it's a good idea, since it's too volatile and it's not
something you're supposed to monitor. Same thing about CPU usage at a
given time. Have you talked to Michael about this?

Of course, nothing prevents you from distributing those patches
yourself, feel free to post them here too.

Cool. You might want to explain the patch a bit better, "fix resize
bar" is a bit too generic. Consider explaining why your changes are
needed, something like "Don't forget to set X on Y." in the short
description. You might want to elaborate on why that's needed in the
long description too, something like "Y needs to have X set so that Y
can do Z without W errors when resizing".

You're also introducing 2 extra blank lines, is that intended?

This sounds interesting, but have you discussed it with Michael first?
I'd recommend always pinging Michael first to see if what you intend
to do is in line with the project goals and things like that. Unless,
of course, you don't care about getting your patches merged.

Anyways, some comments below.

> Oops... I messed it up.

Please merge both patches in a single one to make it easier to review
(unless they do separate things, of course).

I noticed you used "if (" and "if(", please stick with "if (" as
that's what the rest of xcb.c uses.

You declare and read bar_hidden, but you never seem to write to it. Am
I missing something? Also, I'd rather have the code that calls
hide/unhide_bar simply not call those functions rather than do the
checking inside the functions, but that's subjective, I guess.

The indentation level on the call to hide_bars() in the last chunk of
the second patch is wrong. Are you sure you don't want that enclosed
by brackets, as part of the "else" branch?

You're doing all the logic in the drawing code. Perhaps it would be
better to detect that stuff directly in the ipc.c, when you receive
the workspace info from i3, after the call to parse_workspaces_json.

It's the same issue explained in x_con_init() at src/x.c

Nah, haven't talked about this with anyone. I just wanted to see my
memstats and hacked it in ;)

I haven't measured it, but as for the kernel-side-code, it seems not to
be much more "volatile" than reading /proc/loadavg or /proc/stat, things
that you already do in i3status.
It simply reads some system-wide-statistics and iterates over some
block-devices to figure out what amount of memory is used for buffers.

The userland does only one read on the proc-file and some
string-matching, which is ugly as hell but should be fast enough to be
negligible (on modern cpu's with things like sseXY or MMX).

If you don't like it, don't use it :)

Fernando is right. memory usage came up quite a few times already, so I decided
to finally add a note to the manpage explaining why we don?t want it in
i3status:

http://code.i3wm.org/i3status/commit/?id=b35753cd

Therefore, I am sorry that your work was "in vain" (well, you are profiting
from it, I guess), but I won?t merge this patch.

Michael

Well, it's up to you. But you maybe want to remove the part about
cpu-usage, because there is a cpu-usage-statistic available in i3status ;)

I didn?t talk about CPU usage. I talked about CPU frequency.

It doesn't matter, the patch must explain what it does or the
description is essentially useless.

Message-ID: <CALfxri+cxAHfp7M+kx-b6pwcTqnteOrO12Zuw+5wykQh=Krn5A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Michael,

I wonder if it is possible to change the keybindings during runtime. What i
want to achieve is dynamically adding named workspaces. Executing

i3-msg workspace 3:emacs

works just fine but I'd really like to access this workspace by keybinding.


i3-msg bindsym Mod4+3 workspace 3:emacs

gives me {"success":false, "error":"syntax error, unexpected $undefined at
position 1"}, so I guess "bindsym" is not an accepted command. Any plans on
changing that? Then of course, there needs to be a way of deleting
keybindings, as well.

Ciao, Marcus

Are you planning on changing that? I mean, i3's workspaces already are
dynamic. They disappear when there are no windows on them, I can add them
on the fly, access them via the next/prev commands etc. It would be really
nice to be able to assign a key to them, too.

Ciao, Marcus

As Fernando said, please resend this patch with a proper description. This will
make it much easier to figure out problems based on the output of "git blame".
A good and clean commit history is something we should keep :).

Here is a patch which enables i3 to use 32bit visual only when needed.

Hi darkraven,

Excerpts from DR's message of 2012-02-27 16:09:07 +0100:
> Here is a patch which enables i3 to use 32bit visual only when needed.
Thanks for your patch. It removes a commandline switch, which is a good thing,
and it seems to work just fine on my system.

Here are a few comments about it:

1) The commit message is far too long and contains a snippet you pasted from
   IRC. I don?t see the reason for that excerpt even being in the commit
   message. Could you reduce the commit message to a reasonable length please?

2) You introduce trailing whitespace in a number of occasions. Please remove that.
   My git log says lines 21, 225, 245, 248 and 268 are affected.

3) In x_con_init(), you create a colormap for each window, without ever freeing
   them. This is an X11 resource leak and will make X11 go out of memory after
   a while. Can you avoid creating new colormaps for every window entirely?

4) Can you please use XCB_COPY_FROM_PARENT instead of an explicit 0 for the
   depth? I think this makes the effect clearer.

5) In get_visual_depth and get_visualid_by_depth, please adhere to our coding
   style: no spaces between the function name and its arguments. So, use
   "xcb_depth_next(&depth_iter)" instead of "xcb_depth_next (&depth_iter)".

Thanks!

Best regards,
Michael
