Michael,

Sorry for the reply on this.

It finally took a strong cold that knocked me out of the office for almost
a week, so I could spend some time to dig into the i3 a little better.

I take back what I said, because the documentation is amazingly detailed
and easy to understand. Practically everything I needed was there, I (and
most) just don't have the time to go through it all at first hand, I guess.
Apologies on that.

I congratulate you guys because, considering what'S out there in terms of
open source projects, this is IMO a very well written documentation.

If I can, just to push my boundaries, say anything, I have one opinion, but
not directly with the documentation website itself, but with the
configuration file:

- Could we place all settings and (brief documentation as comments) inside
the configuration template, like other big projects similarly do? (Apache,
PHP, MySQL, etc). The fact it is all there, with default values, showing
how it is behaving as of that moment kind of explains it better than an
extensive document online.

Looking at some configs people shared here within this thread (thanks for
that), I reckon most of them end up doing something similar to that, even
placing their own comments to remind them about what that particular
section is about... Maybe having this by default could help exposing all
theses features at once.

Regards,

Hey,

in an attempt to provide useful answers to questions about i3 and
related topics, I set up http://faq.i3wm.org/. It?s a stackexchange-like
site where you can post (or find) questions and answers.

Please give it a shot for your next question and, whenever you get a
question answered on a different way (for example on this mailing list,
on IRC or even in real life), please post your question + answer on that
site so that other people can read the answer, too :).

Best regards,
Michael

No. I know a few other projects which do it like that, most notably
dovecot. I think that a huge file like that places a big burden on
people who look at the configuration file for the first time due to
information overload, therefore discouraging people to get into the
configuration.

Additionally, we have everything in the userguide because, being an HTML
document, it looks a lot better. You have nice formatting, graphics,
sections, different font sizes, etc. All of that is not achievable with
ASCII (at least not as good). I want to make the documentation as
appealing as possible.

Best regards,
Michael

Michael,

That is a great idea! I reckon the faq style is much easier to track,
follow up and search than mailing lists!

I will try to participate as much as I can!

Message-ID: <CABUeae8MHUfccnny4oaGkkz+gJauDeKArb4Y59zUCH_ABFvhNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is my first post to this list, so hello everyone!

I use i3 on Arch:

$ i3 --version
i3 version 4.2-58-gecd238b (2012-06-03, branch "next") ? 2009-2012
Michael Stapelberg and contributors

I've noticed strange problem with Vim in graphical mode.
In ~/.gvimrc I have configure font with:

set noanti gfn=Terminus

When I open not-so-huge file, e.g. ~/.i3/config, then it takes a few
seconds until I see the file content. I can see gVim slowly rendering
it from top to bottom.

I have a decent machine:
ThinkPad T400
Intel CPU P8600 @ 2.40GHz
Intel Graphics i915
8GB RAM

Here is complete set of my Vim dotfiles:
https://github.com/mloskot/dotfiles/tree/master/vim

Have I misconfigured anything here or there is an issue in i3?

p.s. i3wm rocks!

Best regards,

Hi,

I had the same problem and the root cause turned out to be the
xf86-video-intel package. I think there is a bug in xf86-video-intel that
causes this. Downgrade and the issue should go away.

I do use this driver indeed:

$ pacman -Si xf86-video-intel
Repository     : extra
Name           : xf86-video-intel
Version        : 2.19.0-3
URL            : http://xorg.freedesktop.org/
...

Downgrade to what? Version older than 2.19.x?
FYI, I use Arch Linux.

Thanks!

I am on Arch as well, the problem occurred after the last update (ca 2
weeks ago for me).
Use downgrade (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Downgrade) to downgrade
xf86-video-intel to 2.18.0-3 and the problem should go away.
I've just checked, and I've downgraded the kernel as well, back to 3.3.2-1,
but I cannot remember if it is necessary or not.

If I remember correctly, then the issue is just in the driver, the
xf86-video-intel package. Downgrade that to said version and the problem
should disappear.

Cheers,

Karl Sutt

Karl,

Thanks for the details and hints.
I may try to downgrade indeed.

Hi guys,

I am new to i3 and I really like it so far, but there is one little 
thing I cannot figure out.
I am using debian testing and xdm to login. I wanted to have autologin 
so I tried lightdm and I also could get autstart to work but i3 wasn't 
accepting commands after login. I have opera as autostart and I was able 
to type in there but i3 wasn't switching workspaces or opening 
workspaces. I am now trying slim but I encounter the same problem.

Regards
Lukas

I never used autologin, so what I say here may be wrong,
but it looks like you were starting opera as your window manager?

Start i3 from the DM, and put
exec opera
into ~/.i3/config to have i3 start your browser on login.

As I said it's just a blind shot.

I do it like this. I start opera from i3's config. Also i3 starts and 
shows the bar and everyhing. Typing in Opera works. But for example 
alt+enter, alt+3,... doesn't. Without autologin everything works fine.

Is it possible the XDM loops back to itself?
Check this Wiki and see if it applies to your case:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDM#XDM_loops_back_to_itself_after_login

Instead of Opera, try to aurostart different application, for example, Firefox.

Also, it's a good idea to post your .xsession to make it easier to
verify there are no other issues.

As I said I am now using slim which starts i3. Is it possible that i3 
for some reason can't read the commands?

slim starts i3 using .xsession (and/or .xinitrc IIRC). so it would be
helpful for you to supply this file.

or try another suggestion, which is to leave opera out of your .i3/config
(or change it to another progra) to se if it might be opera specific.

IIRC I dumped slim because it had some problems with standard input
and it crippled my virtual console. I don't know if this problem
may cause wrong capturing of keyboard combos, but everything's possible.

BTW, if slim expects config in ~/.xinitrc, is it still X11/freedesktop
compatible?
AFAIK, a DM should stick to ~/.xsession and stay away from ~/.xinitrc
which is for exclusive use by xinit.

It's been a long time since I ran slim, and when I started using it I had
been using xinit. Entirely possible that I had to ln -s .xinitrc .xsession
and have since forgotten that step.

Sorry for keeping you waiting, but cause my college's end-of-term is
coming, recently I've been very busy.
As soon as the term ends, I'll be working on problems you suggests.

Subject: [i3] i3 emacs integration
Message-ID: <CAJ9rA26YM4i_zyz0xf9EvV6fxXOZNjYESfZY9RBVDg6j2AX9sA@mail.gmail.com>

I've been using i3 for about a month now and I'm loving it. I was looking
for tiling manager that will manage windows as my Emacs does and i3 is the
only one I can find. I consider myself lucky that it is also stable, light
and under very active development.

However, Emacs doesn't play nice with it out of the box. So I wrote a very
basic integration layer that changes the way Emacs manages its frames so it
relies on i3 to manage window layout instead of emulating it.

I just made it available at http://github.com/vava/i3-emacs
It requires Emacs 24 to be fully functioning however i3 IPC bindings will
work fine with older versions of Emacs.

Hope it will be useful for someone else,
best regards,
Vadim.

I figuered it out. It was a problem with my keyboard layout since I am 
using Neo2. I had to update some xkb stuff.

Hi,

Inspired by Michael's talk recently published by GoogleTechTalks on YouTube,
I'd like to share one observation about reporting bugs to i3wm.
In the video, Michael mentioned simplicity of bugs reporting is crucial.
Lately, at least 2-3 people asked on IRC how to report a bug to i3wm.

AFAIS, there is no guideline published anywhere.
Neither on Contact [1] page, nor in the header of the Trac [2].

IMHO, it's always good to make explicit guideline somewhere.

[1] http://i3wm.org/contact/
[2] http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/report/2

I think this is pretty interesting. We have a big button stating "bugs"
on our website. After clicking there, there is a button saying "new
ticket". I think that?s pretty obvious, especially for our target
audience of advanced users and developers. What I was talking about in
the tech talk was that there should be no obstacles like forced
registration.

Anyway, that being said, I welcome anything which makes it more
straight-forward to report a bug. That may be as simple as a better
input form for trac (stackoverflow-style?). Maybe there already are such
projects. Ideas and feedback welcome.

Best regards,
Michael

Yes, for myself the path to a bug report or where to send patches
is clear and straightforward indeed. Perhaps it would help some folks
if it is marked with bigger signs. It's just an observation.

Yes, and i3's approach is really good.

Is there a need for anything simpler really?
I think Trac is minimalistic here.

Perhaps "How to report a bug or send a patch?" clearly answered
in the faq.i3wm.org and linked from /contact page would do the job
for those who need it.

I particularly like the simplicity of Trac, and always use it for my
projects.

But I felt a bit discouraged to report bugs because of lack of feedback
(many of them without response or follow up).
Maybe there is a resource problem, and I totally understand that, but it
would be nice to receive any type of feedback (even a "hell, we don't care
about that" would be fine). :-)

Ugh, I?m terribly sorry. This was one of the things I could do easily
when the project was still small and I had a lot more time. Lately I
need to focus on my studies, so I can?t answer to every ticket in a
reasonable timeframe.

I?m uncertain whether a ticket status "A human skimmed over your ticket
and it?s not total bullshit" would make things any better. Any comments?

Best regards,
Michael

Sure thing. Respect and appreciation to the time you manage to put
in.

You are blazingly fast when something pops up on the irc channel. If
it were possible, it would probably be better to increase the lag on
irc, for the sake of being a bit faster on the bug reports. I don't
know for real, but the people who report something have put a bit
more effort in it. 

But, there is this saying in my language: The best sailors are
standing ashore :) 

I could join a bug triaging party on irc on some lazy sunday, but be
aware that my participation will possibly cost more time than it will
gain :) 

Cheers,

Depends. Often, bugreports can be closed because they are a duplicate
(the person did not search the bugtracker before reporting), or already
fixed in the current git version (the person did not update and
reproduce before reporting) or because they are not actually describing
a bug.

Any help is welcome. Your participation might cost more time once, but
I?m sure it?ll be useful after a while. Are there more people willing to
help out with this? If so, I?d setup a doodle to find a date/time which
suits most people.

Best regards,
Michael

I'm also willing to help and I will have some ?free? time after exams.
I hope not to slow you down. ;-)  Maybe I'll try to fix bugs I reported?

Best regards.

Hei Michael,

No need to apologise, at all!

I just felt worth sharing it so we might, step by step, find ways to help
you out as much as we can. And I can see there are some people interest in
it, which is pretty good!

For some bug reports I have made in past (specially debian/ubuntu stuff),
my experience was a bit like that. They were very fast to "categorize" the
problem, "assign" to a particular developer, etc... but most of them get
really fixed and go upstream after a year or 2, which is pretty slow... So
I figure that the triage process can walk separately from the
development/patching process. But I am not sure on the size of their dev
teams compared to i3, and up to which extend this could apply here. Just a
though though.

Cheers,

Sounds great. I'll be rather busy the next few months, but I'll
probably be able to dedicate a sunday to this, please let me know if
you need any help setting up any infrastructure or anything like that.

Message-ID: <CAMJW5=3NGE=beZ6wzHhk0_3Xm6CX0vCAr-r3VzKZuUYrHzy_Uw@mail.gmail.com>

(Eventually I've got some time to rework patches I sent previously. I
divide them into mutually unrelated parts, and will send them in different
threads, according to Fernando's suggestion. So this is the first one).

Currently i3 sends event with quite bad timing. For example, the workspaces
event 'focus' is sent before the tree_render() is called (in other words,
the focus has not been actually changed, only the internal states of i3wm
is changed). Although the differences is just fractions of a second, it may
confuse some applications which rely heavily on the correct timing (for
example, i3bar with my upcoming patches).

So I add facilities to queue outward events up until the tree_render is
done.

Generally, these patches make workspaces events sent by i3wm more useful.

A bug is fixed as well.

That does make sense to me. Is there any reason why we might not want
to queue the events? If so, the IPC API could be simplified a bit. I'd
prefer if ipc_queue/unqueue_event() were renamed to ipc_start_queuing
and ipc_stop_queuing_and_drain. ipc_send_event_unqueue doesn't fully
describe what the function does either.

That said, in situations like this, when you have to make a design
decision, I'd recommend talking to Michael before actually working on
the code.

Other than those pending design decisions, the patch looks good. A few nitpicks:

* Please make ipc_is_queued static.

* Please use foo(void) instead of foo(). foo(void) is the prototype of
an ANSI C function that takes no arguments, whereas foo() is the
declaration of a K&R function.

* Keep the functions separated by an empty line in ipc.c (check how
other functions are separated in that file).

* In ipc.h, add the documentation on top of the function prototypes,
using "/**" in the first line of the comment (take a look at other
functions).

* You might want to document ipc_send_event_unqueue better. Also,
please punctuate the documentation of a function.

If those patches depend on stuff implemented in the patch you sent to
list earlier, it's better to wait until that patch gets accepted to
avoid confusion. Anyways, some of the things I said in response to
your first patch also apply to those patches. One extra thing, check
the indentation in the last call to send_workspace_event in 0001.

Out of curiosity, could you elaborate on why your approach would be
better than simply calling get_workspace when we receive a
notification that something happened? Your approach seems cleaner, but
it does add some complexity to i3bar.

One last thing, about the bug that "0003-Fix-a-bug-..." fixes. Is the
bug present in the current code base, or is it a bug that you
introduced with your patches? If the latter, it might be better to
squash it with the commit that introduced the bug.

I think I can express my idea clearer with code, and code could help
Michael make decision more easily.

Anyway, I code for my own needs. If this patch got rejected, I will use it
with my i3wm.

I don?t understand why you need this distinction. For which feature
precisely is it important that the X11 representation is most likely (!)
changed? Could you elaborate a bit please?

Subject: [i3] Tray Icons Disappearing on i3bar
Message-ID: <CAAuVr72wKz-_WGXYisGFNt1=_q6WpxeC_vcCz8q-RLgsQU+s1A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am experiencing this annoying behaviour for some icons in the tray bar.
They sometimes disappear out of nowhere, sometimes after coming back from
suspend, or when I relload the i3 config (by hitting Mod+Shift+R).
I couldn't quite capture this with a screen recording app, so I took the
video with my mobile: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrKxKjj08e8

It always happens with checkgmail icon, but intermittently with Skype as
well.

I tried to check the logs, but there was nothing there. Even though the
icons are gone, the applications are still running.
I also tried to run those applications on foreground to see if they would
throw some output that would help me track the problem, but nothing.

Does anyone have similar issues, or any ideas on how can I "debug" or "fix"
this?

Cheers,

I took a look at your addition, but I think you can express that even
better. Currently, you propose:

-it has. This is useful in case you are changing the workspace?s name
-dynamically.
+it has. So, in case you are changing a workspace?s name dynamically and
make use
+of the keyboard shortcuts, adding the keyword +number+ to your
keybinds. 

However, your main sentence is "adding the keyword number to your
keybinds", which is not a grammatically correct sentence :). Also, it
could be clearer on what to do. Adding the keyword could mean anything.
I think giving an example of how it looks before and after the change
could help here?

What do the others think? Any native speakers? :)

Best regards,
Michael

It seems like I can reproduce it with checkgmail.

You can enable more debugging in i3bar (which provides the tray) by
using the "verbose yes" statement in your bar configuration block.

Anyway, please open a new ticket for this and attach the information we
have so far. The mailing list is not the perfect place to have this
conversation :).

Michael

Hi,

is there a way to move a tag from one screen to another? I've got the
problem that all my windows are on the notebook. When I attach an
external monitor, I want to move the whole tag (workspace) to this
screen. Is there a solution for that?

Greetings,

Check the command "move workspace to output":

Repeat ?focus parent? until you select all windows and then move them
to another workspace like if you were to move a single window.
If you repeat the command too many times, issue ?focus child? once.

I've told you that problem before. The auto-hiding i3bar causes the
workspace immediately switch back after switch to another workspace.

The solution you suggests is to hide i3bar after receive the reply of
'workspace' command. I deceided not to use that solution after some
thoughts: 1)what if the 'workspace' command isn't issued by i3bar? 2)My
attempt to make a event-based i3bar would be meaningless if I use this
solution.

So this patch is the solution I come up with.

(I don't know, but could the X11 representation be unchanged after a
tree_render()?)

I think I've been observing similar issue.

I use XChat.
Everytime I restart i3 (SHIFT+mod+R) its icon disappears.

All my dotfiles are in https://github.com/mloskot/archlinux-config
in home/mloskot/.config folder.

Hi Michael,

Thanks for the feedback. Yeah, so it looks like something to verify more
carefully.

I will try to produce a better report and open a ticket in Trac... and, if
I can, try to debug it myself too and minimize your workload :-).

Best,

When i3 is restarted, so is i3bar. Looks like when i3bar quits, its
window is destroyed and the embedded windows receive a BadWindow error
[1]. Seems to be a design issue in XEmbed itself:

"The protocol, as currently constituted, is not robust against the
embedder crashing. This will result in the embedder window being
destroyed by the X server, and, as a consequence client's window being

a BadWindow error."

What happens here, I guess, is that some clients may try to create the
tray icon again, while others may not. Or maybe they do, but i3bar
wasn't up by the time they retry (I'm guessing here, I really didn't
read XEmbed).

XEmbed also says that "the protocol ends" when the embedded window is
reparented to the root window [2]. So I don't know much about X, but
maybe reparenting the embedded windows to the root window before
terminating would be a solution? I'm not sure how the clients are
supposed to react, though.

What puzzles me is that you guys say it also happens when returning
from suspend... I have no idea why that is, I always thought suspend
was (mostly) transparent to applications?

Hi Fernando,

Thanks a lot for the thorough feedback and report.

Yep, it happens after suspend with me every time. I am using Ubuntu, and it
has its lock screen (sorry, I don't know details of the under-the-covers
here), so this could maybe triggering a reload of the wm?

There's no xcb_sync, but I think anything you "get" from the server
would "sync" the connection like XSync, if I understand how X works
(and that's probably where Michael drew inspiration for sync_with_i3
in the testcases). So yes, the server representation could be
unchanged after a tree_render. It all depends if you get anything back
from X in tree_render *after* you xcb_flushed the commands that you
wanted to flush in order to change the server representation the way
you intended. So maybe you're just narrowing the window for a race
condition.

That got truncated. "(though I think in theory the data could be stuck

So could we just use xcb_aux_sync() (or similar approach)?

They shouldn?t, though. Have a look at the code. When i3bar receives an
EOF (or does it not receive an EOF in that case? maybe we should make it
restart-aware) it first properly kills all embedded tray icons.

> What happens here, I guess, is that some clients may try to create the

In case they don?t retry, they are violating the spec. Also, the
embedder can be down for an arbitrary amount of time. The tray
application is supposed to deal with that. And at least nm-applet does
(so do all GTK-based ones probably). Note however that when the embedder
does not properly kill the tray clients, they may not retry at all. So
this is probably what?s happening here (as you described above).

As I said, we should be doing that :).

Yes, it definitely should be transparent to applications. My guess is
that for some reason, a monitor reconfiguration event is sent and i3
restarts i3bar because of that. However, that?s a different code path
than the i3 restart, so it?s quite a mystery to me currently.

Best regards,
Michael

I?d like to avoid that. We currently have no place in the code where we
do that, and it?s a good thing.

I?ll read your e-mail explanation and will try to reproduce your
original problem, then come up with a better reply. Give me a few hours
;-).

Unfortunately, I haven?t found the original description of the problem
you were referring to. I?ve searched the bugtracker and my emails, but I
guess we only talked about it on IRC?

Anyway, I assume the problem is that i3bar sends the workspace command
to i3 and then unhides, which generates an EnterNotify event for a
window on the current workspace. i3 then gets scheduled, sees the
workspace command, switches to the target workspace and then processes
the EnterNotify event, which leads to switching back to the old
workspace.

To avoid this situation, I would recommend the following:
After sending the workspace command, i3bar needs to perform a
sync_with_i3 sequence, as used in the testcases (see [1]) and
documented at [2]. Afterwards, i3bar can be sure that X11 has been
updated and it can safely unmap itself.

As for the situation where other clients send a workspace event and
i3bar unmaps in such a timeframe that the same race condition is
triggered, the other client has to perform a sync_with_i3, too. In
addition, it has to call xcb_grab_server() before sending the workspace
event and xcb_ungrab_server() after the sync_with_i3. This will
guarantee that no Unmap-requests by i3bar will be processed by X11 in
the meantime.

Best regards,
Michael

Cool.

This should solve the problem, but wouldn't my solution make things simpler?

PS. I have had a little thought about the situation you suggest where X
representation is not changed after tree_render(). Wouldn't the unmap
command sent by i3bar queued after those sent by i3 in Xorg buffer? If so,
it won't be a problem.

I don?t think so. What I was suggesting is already working and the same
technique as used in the testcases, so I?d really prefer that a lot in
comparison to touching quite some amount of code.

You cannot make this assumption because of how i3 and i3bar might get
scheduled on your CPU.

Michael
