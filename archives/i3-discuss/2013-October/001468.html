<PRE>I actually like this idea myself, and I've been using i3 exclusively for a 
few months now, and i3 was my first entry into tiling wms. I still
consider myself a novice though - I think I've basically learned just 
enough work fairly comfortably, but have no doubt acquired a few bad habits
and gaping holes in my understanding along the way. So excuse me if I 
misuse terms or show any obvious signs of luser. (:

To use Sylvain's summary: &quot;a sticky/protected container which can freeze its 
structure and delegate it to the next container (or create a new one if required).&quot;

... is something I would be able to immediately put to use in my usual
workfow.

In particular, the IntelliJ Idea editor is difficult to work with due to
the way it opens new editor windows. I want to have the main application
window remain ever-present to the left-half portion of my screen in
stacking mode, while each new editor window I open should appear to the 
right-half, also in stacking mode. So that each successive new editor
window opens to the right of the main application window, and is 
stacked below one another.

I believe that the feature in question would really make the above
scenario convenient and straight-forward, and doesn't require extra
keystrokes/commands or configuration to utilize other than the single 
'sticky/protected' command.


Kind regards!
