<PRE>&gt;<i> Another thing that gets me everytime is to be in resize mode and
</I>&gt;<i> forgetting about it. A timeout for that would be nice.
</I>
Personally I bind mod+control+j/k/l/; to resize. Then I don't need to
switch modes at all to resize. IMO mode switching should be reserved
for ultra-rare actions (and preferably a one-shot thing that returns
to the default mode as part of it's action) and resizing windows is
something I do quite frequently.


I do find I often mix up the directions to resize and have to correct myself:

- If I'm resizing a window that happens to be at the top-left,
everything is fine because the directions correspond to the direction
that the only free corner (i.e. the bottom-right corner) will move.

- If I'm resizing a window that happens to be at the bottom-right, I
get everything backwards because the directions still correspond to
the bottom-right corner, but that isn't the corner that is moving (the
top-left corner will move).

- If I'm resizing a window somewhere in the middle of the screen I
tend to get mixed up some/most of the time, because although I'm
pressing ONE direction, the window resizes in TWO directions (i.e. I
pressed resize right, but the window expanded both left and right).

I'm not really sure what a good solution to that is :-/

I'm thinking about swapping the vertical resize keys so both expand
keys (l/;) are on the right and both shrink keys are on the left
(h/j), but I'll probably end up with just as much brainfuck, only in
different circumstances...

Cheers,
-Ian
