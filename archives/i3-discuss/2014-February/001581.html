<PRE>Howdy,

I'm currently playing with the i3 testing framework in order to learn 
how to provide a test case for the proposed IPC event extension.

After some fiddling, I've come up with the following test case to ensure 
that opening a window results in two window events, &quot;new&quot; and &quot;focus&quot;, 
in that order.

Below is the source code of the test:

======================================================
#!perl

use i3test;
use threads;
use threads::shared;

my $i3 = i3(get_socket_path());
$i3-&gt;connect()-&gt;recv;

################################
# Window event
################################

# Events

my @events :shared;
my $subscribed :shared;

sub record_events() {
     $i3-&gt;subscribe({
         window =&gt; sub {
             my ($event) = @_;
             say 'received '.$event-&gt;{change};
             push @events, $event-&gt;{change};
         }
     })-&gt;recv;

     $subscribed = 1;

     say 'subscribed';

     AE::cv-&gt;recv;
}

sub count_events() {
     my $count = 0;

     while ($count &lt; 15 &amp;&amp; @events &lt; 2) {
         $count++;
         select(undef, undef, undef, 0.1);
     }
}

my $t1 = threads-&gt;new( {'void' =&gt; 1}, sub { record_events() });
my $t2 = threads-&gt;new( {'void' =&gt; 1}, sub { count_events() });

while (!$subscribed) {
     select(undef, undef, undef, 0.1);
}

open_window;

$t2-&gt;join();

say 'number of events '<A HREF="http://infra.in.zekjur.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/i3-discuss">. at events</A> ;

foreach (@events) {
     say 'event='.$_;
  }

ok(@events eq 2, 'Window event count correct');
ok($events[0] eq 'new', 'Window &quot;new&quot; event received');
ok($events[1] eq 'focus', 'Window &quot;focus&quot; event received');

done_testing;
======================================================


Now, this seems to work most of the time, but sometimes the test fails 
with the following output:


======================================================
Test output:
[:1] t/205-ipc-windows.t: starting
[:1] t/205-ipc-windows.t: finished
output for t/205-ipc-windows.t:
subscribed
received focus
number of events 1
event=focus
not ok 1 - Window event count correct

#   Failed test 'Window event count correct'
#   at ./t/205-ipc-windows.t line 79.
not ok 2 - Window &quot;new&quot; event received

#   Failed test 'Window &quot;new&quot; event received'
#   at ./t/205-ipc-windows.t line 80.
Use of uninitialized value $events[1] in string eq at 
./t/205-ipc-windows.t line 81.
not ok 3 - Window &quot;focus&quot; event received

#   Failed test 'Window &quot;focus&quot; event received'
#   at ./t/205-ipc-windows.t line 81.
1..3
======================================================


Only the focus event is received. But when I check the corresponding log 
file, it clearly says two events have been sent! (See the attached log 
file).

This makes me wonder. Is this approach ill fated and simply not robust 
enough? Or does it seem suspicious that only one event is received while 
two events were sent? The subscription seems to be established before 
any event is sent, but the first event is still lost!?

Thanks for any feedback you can provide.

Cheers,
   Marco
