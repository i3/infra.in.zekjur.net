Subject: [PATCH] remove unnecessary code in render_con().

The removed code was add by commit 61b8a62 to fix #564. That bug is cause
by rendering the mplayer window again as a floating window (even if it
has been rendered before as a fullscreen window, at line 202). So simply
checking for fullscreen window is enough to solve this problem. Treating
floating/tiling fullscreen window differently is not needed.
