Subject: [i3] key for showing version
Message-ID: <20111001115247.1b3883a3@sid>

Is there a way of displaying the i3 version. I have looked through the
docs and config files without luck.

thanks.

You can run 'i3 --version' to get the version of the binary. Also, the version
is logged to stdout when starting (also when restarting).

The idea of implementing an IPC command to get the version has come up, but so
far, nobody did it.

Best regards,
Michael

yes, this is the way the snapping should work. snaps window on
specified threshold. i really don't like the way of 'signalling'
something to the user, it seems pretty ugly to me. the user should use
snapping or shouldn't. this is the way the most systems offer
(actually i haven't seen another way).

> 2) You don?t consider dock clients but always snap to the screen edges.

hmm, i can observe different bahaviour. i'm running i3bar this way:
i3bar -d bottom
and all the windows are respecting this border. have you got some
other informations about this?

i'm sorry :)

ok, this is the beauty of open source. i have my own branch including
my patch and using/improving it (while trying to keep it in sync) and
i really enjoy using i3 this way

thanks for your hints ;)
maybe i'll try it later

Hi there,

If you prefer to follow mailing lists using a news reader, the i3-discuss and
i3-announce mailing lists can now be tracked via Gmane.

i3-discuss can be reached via gmane.comp.window-managers.i3.general and i3-
announce can be reached via gmane.comp.window-managers.i3.announce (actually,
the latter will be created when the next message is sent to it).

Both groups are marked as non-public, which means anyone can receive messages,
but one must be subscribed to the list to send messages.

Cheers,
Raphael

Subject: [i3] Please test i3lock from git
Message-ID: <1319985773-sup-905@stapelberg.de>

Hi,

Recently, there have been two commits to i3lock which are rather important:

a803ba931e74e6f99a478584e1280626c0c880e3
    Bugfix: Don?t re-grab pointer/keyboard on MappingNotify (Thanks wilmer)

8e153411b507b499e3bd12bbc1ca67e592cb4657
    Correctly handle Mode_switch/ISO_Level3_Shift (Thanks bacardi55)

The first one is security relevant (but not critical) and the second one might
fix problems for you if you are using a keyboard layout that makes use of
Mode_switch or ISO_Level3_Shift and you are using a character which requires
one of these modifiers in your password.

Regardless of whether you think the commits affect you, it would be great if
you could install i3lock from git and check that it still works for you. Please
send me a short email if it works and a more detailed one if it doesn?t :).

Instructions for installing it from git:

    $ git clone git://code.i3wm.org/i3lock
    $ cd i3lock
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

If you are using Debian, you can install the build dependencies using sudo
apt-get build-dep i3lock.

I am planning to release i3lock v2.2 in a few days (unless any new problems
come up now).

Thanks in advance,
Best regards,
Michael

Hi Michael,

It seems to work fine for me.   I do get the following:

WARNING: unhandled event of type 19
WARNING: unhandled event of type 12

but nothing seems to be misbehaving.

Thanks,
Daniel Steen
