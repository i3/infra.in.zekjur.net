<PRE>Hi all,

though not really i3-specific, there were a few people in the
past who asked in the IRC-channel for a command launcher with history
support and tab-completion. Some people use bashrun for that, some
people where referred to shellex, an old try at a zsh based launcher of
mine, which was in no state to use.

I recently restarted work on shellex [1] and would like to announce it here
in case anyone is still looking for such a thing. It is still WIP and
not yet as comfortable to use as dmenu, but I now consider it stable
enough to be used and to be usefull (for example history and tab
completion worked on every system I tried).

Kind Regards,

Merovius
