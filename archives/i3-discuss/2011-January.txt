Subject: [i3] [PATCH] Build fix: Include xcb/xcb.h before cfgparse.tab.h.
Message-ID: <1295718671-8539-1-git-send-email-kubito@gmail.com>

cfgparse.tab.h uses uint32_t, which is defined in stdint.h, included
by xcb/xcb.h.

If the current include order is used, uint32_t is used before it is
defined, which causes compilation to break.

Should fix the build of 3.?-bf2 on FreeBSD.

Thanks guys,

Yeah, I saw that, and it looked like it might work, but what made me see if there was something better was this:

mode "resize" {
   ...
   bind 36 mode default
}

Which you've confirmed below... you're kinda "stuck" there until you explicitly get out, as opposed to just executing the command and being done after it executes.  However, this looks like it'll do alright.

Thanks a lot,
Derek

P.S. Would there be any plan to add this in the future?  I may hack at it, but it would be at work, and I'd have to fly it by legal :)

This is possible using modes, see for example [1] or take the following (untested) example:

  mode "leader" {
    bindsym t exec /usr/bin/urxvt
    bindsym b exec /usr/bin/firefox
    bindsym Enter mode default
  }
  
  bindsym Mod1+a mode leader

Please note that there is no concept of a timeout (so when pressing Mod1+a and
then pressing nothing, you are still stuck in the leader mode and need to press
Enter to get out of it). Also, there is no visual indication about modes at the
moment.

Best regards,
Michael

Modes are hackish for this sort of thing (leader -> key -> enter).

This is why i wrote xgsk: https://github.com/edelkind/xgsk

It's a more generic option, and requires that, if you want to execute
window manager actions, you communicate back with your window manager
using IPC or EWMH (see `wmctrl`).  i3 doesn't currently support either
of these _very well_, and the latter is barely supported at all.  But
maybe it'll work for you.

Directly after writing the mail I added the feature to my "would be nice" list.
Top priority at the moment is getting the tree branch in shape, afterwards we
can think about this kind of stuff :).

The best way to communicate back with i3 is to use its IPC interface, which
should cover all your needs with regard to keybindings. See i3-msg(1) for a
readily-available tool to use the IPC interface.

Ok, thx.  So if I'm reading this right, I'd do the following:

	bindsym Control+k myscript

Where 'myscript' looks something like:

	val=$(xgsk -r -t 500)
	case $val in
		k)
			i3-msg k
			;;
	fi
	return 0
	
Or is there a better way to go?

The 'mode' binding is causing me problems... I can't seem to get the mode back to default.  If I can make this work, I'll be a happy dood.

Thx,
Derek

I'm not currently running i3, but you could try something like the
following, using only i3's native commands:

mode "wsmode" {
    bind 10 exec sh -c "i3-msg 1; i3-msg 'mode default'"
    bind 11 exec sh -c "i3-msg 2; i3-msg 'mode default'"
    bind 12 exec sh -c "i3-msg 3; i3-msg 'mode default'"
    bind 36 mode default
}

bindsym Mod4+w mode wsmode

I seem to remember i3 having problems with executing an IPC-triggered
mode switch, but that was a while ago, and it's possible that the
issue has since been rectified (or that i'm simply smoking crack, and
my memory is faulty).  Either way, with this method, you won't get a
timeout unless you're pretty creative, and you won't get a
default-mode-switch-on-unknown-key-press without a lot of superfluous
key bindings.  Still, if you try it, let us know if it functions as
expected.

Hi,

Having read the past emails on this it intrigued me.
Maybe a 'simple' solution would be for the mode line to
simply indicate if it was "sticky" or not. A sticky
mode wouldn't exit, whereas a non-sticky mode would by
default leave after the command was executed.

So:

mode "resize" stick { ...
	# needed to exit mode
	bind 36 mode default 
}

mode "skimpy" {
	...
	# no mode sym since each command automagically exits the mode
}

Maybe I'll download Tree and find that code. My C unfortunately is as
good as my Perl. Caveat emptor!

Hi,

if I'm not totally mistaken, the new command-parser of -tree was
supposed to support command-chaining, I remember explicitly talking
about that to sECuRE. So with command-chaining you could do something
like the ?bind Mod1+34 exec 'i3-msg "h"; i3-msg "mode default"'?-stuff
with i3-internals.
Iirc the mode-stuff was one of the reasons I suggested command-chaining
as a vital part of any new command-syntax in the first place.

So though sECuRE noted it as ?nice to have? my answer would have
actually been ?planned for -tree? ;)

Greetings,

Merovius

No, unfortunately not. Keep in mind that i3 is primarily a tiling window
manager, not a floating one :). You could submit a feature request (but it
doesn?t have high priority right now) or a patch (if you decide for the patch,
please use the tree branch).

Best regards,
Michael

hi,

i am trying to get names of all windows handled by the wm.

A window manager handles all windows except for those with override_redirect =
1. You can get a list of all windows/their IDs using 'xwininfo -root -children'
on the commandline. To find out if a window has the override_redirect flag,
use:

$ xwininfo -id 0x121286b|grep 'Override Redirect'
  Override Redirect State: yes

Of course, doing this in a program rather than on shell is most likely more
performant. Probably there are also other solutions. i3 itself won?t help you
much on this one, though (there?s no IPC function to do this).

Best regards,
Michael

Hi,

I'm taking a stab at getting i3 configured on Ubuntu 10.10, coming from using ion many years ago.  One of the great features I liked about ion was the nested key bindings you could have, something like:

bindsym Control+k {
            bindsym k wck
            bindsym j wcj
            ...
}

This gives me more of that "vim feeling" where I can do things like: 'map ,of :call ...', so I'm not holding down Shift+Mod1+Contro+k or whatever... Does anyone know if this is possible or if there's some other feature that can mimic this, or even do better?

Thanks a lot,
Derek

This is possible using modes, see for example [1] or take the following (untested) example:

  mode "leader" {
    bindsym t exec /usr/bin/urxvt
    bindsym b exec /usr/bin/firefox
    bindsym Enter mode default
  }
  
  bindsym Mod1+a mode leader

Please note that there is no concept of a timeout (so when pressing Mod1+a and
then pressing nothing, you are still stuck in the leader mode and need to press
Enter to get out of it). Also, there is no visual indication about modes at the
moment.

Best regards,
Michael
