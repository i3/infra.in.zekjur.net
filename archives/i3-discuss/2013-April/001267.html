<PRE>Hi all,

basically I like Michael's way, just a few additional questions/thoughts:

How does the manual toggling play together with the autohiding and the
urgency-hint? Because I (obviously) like the way it's done now, in
general, but also would want to take advantage of an explizit hiding or
showing (for example hiding it despite urgency-hints during
presentations, or watch some output of i3bar for a while).
There are a couple of reasonings one could take, which would suggest
different behaviours, I for my reason would like the following, if it is
not too complicated: When mode is hide, do the old autohiding thing, if
sent a &#8222;hide&#8220;-command, make it hidden (i.e. ignore urgency-hints and
hide-modificator), if sent a &#8222;show&#8220;-command, make it show (i.e. treat
the hide-modificator as always pressed).

Excerpts from Michael Stapelberg's message of 2013-04-13 15:59:14 +0200:
&gt;<i> 2) Introduce a new i3 command named &#8220;bar toggle&#8221; (bonus points for also
</I>&gt;<i>    implementing &#8220;bar show&#8221; and &#8220;bar hide&#8221;, they are trivial), that
</I>&gt;<i>    optionally accepts a parameter, which is the bar id.
</I>
For this, imho, there should also (but possibly later in a seperate
patch) be a way to identify the bar in the config. As far as I know, the
identifier currently is a random string generated by i3, but if there
are key-bindings in the i3-config to controll the bars, this is not
sufficient, because it is only know at runtime (is it?).

&gt;<i> 3) Users configure e.g. &#8220;bindsym $mod+x bar toggle&#8221; in their i3 config,
</I>&gt;<i>    i3 sends the config update with &#8220;hidden&#8221; as state to all bar
</I>&gt;<i>    instances (or only the specified one).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The advantages are:
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; i3 already provides keybinding configuration, so it should probably go
</I>&gt;<i>   into i3 anyways
</I>
Again, in the long-run, this could also mean simplifying i3bar by
ripping out all this key-handling-code and have i3 handle that - it
would only be the continuation of that logic. That would mean that (to
make the current behaviour possible) we need to be able to make bindings
on key-press and key-releases.


Well, all that just as general thoughts ;) The latter two have no
immediate significance to this feature, but the first should be decided.
