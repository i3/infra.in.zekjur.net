<PRE>Hi Eric,

&quot;Eric S. Raymond&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://infra.in.zekjur.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/i3-discuss">esr at thyrsus.com</A>&gt; writes:
&gt;<i> There is one thing I miss from conventional window managers, though,
</I>&gt;<i> and I am wondering if it could be integrated into i3's model.  The
</I>&gt;<i> practical problem is that I normally want both my terminal emulators
</I>&gt;<i> and my Emacs windows to have a fixed 80-column width (unless I
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly resize them), in order for the text displays to look
</I>&gt;<i> natural.
</I>In practice it boils down to this (for me):

The number of columns (with &#8220;natural&#8221; looking windows inside) you can
have on a specific monitor depends on that monitor&#8217;s width. E.g., with
my 1280 px notebook screen, I can have two terminal emulators or emacs
windows next to each other. On a bigger screen, I could fit three or
four columns.

Therefore, I usually work with &#8220;workspace_layout&#8221; stacked and create a
fixed number of columns: Mod+Enter, Mod+u (focus parent),
Mod+Enter. This entirely eliminates the need for your suggested feature.

&gt;<i> My normal practice when suggesting a feature like this would be to
</I>&gt;<i> ship a patch implementing it, and I apologize for not doing so. But it
</I>&gt;<i> seems like a simple enough idea to be implemented very quickly by
</I>&gt;<i> someone who (unlike me) already knows the window manager internals.
</I>I think you are _very_ wrong. Implementing a feature such as this one is
quite a difficult task with many subtleties. Additionally, I think it
doesn&#8217;t really fit well into the concept of i3 and makes the whole thing
even harder to understand.

If you come up with a patch though, I&#8217;d give it a look to see how it
feels before judging.
