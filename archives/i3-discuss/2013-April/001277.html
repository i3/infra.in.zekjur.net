<PRE>Hi Michael,

regarding the first version of my uploaded patch for showing/hiding 
i3bar through i3, I was thinking about further steps and came to the 
conclusion that it might be desirable to fully control hiding and 
showing of i3bar through i3. This was already mentioned by Axel Wagner 
in a previous post:

&quot;Again, in the long-run, this could also mean simplifying i3bar by
ripping out all this key-handling-code and have i3 handle that - it
would only be the continuation of that logic. That would mean that (to
make the current behaviour possible) we need to be able to make bindings
on key-press and key-releases.&quot;

This makes sense to me. Further, I think we could actually also remove 
the logic for unhiding because of urgency hints or a newly activated 
mode from i3bar. Then either i3 could handle unhiding by initiating a 
state update or we could even leave this to ipc scripts, which react to 
the corresponding events. In case we would want to this, the &quot;forcehide&quot; 
option should actually become a mode, and we should reduce the state to 
only have the options &quot;hide&quot; and &quot;show&quot;. So, the mode &quot;forcehide&quot; in 
i3bar would just ignore state updates when it comes to unhiding or 
showing the bar. Additionally, if i3 fully controls the state of the 
i3bar instances, the state in the barconfig always really reflects the 
actual state of the bar (currently i3 does not know about an internal 
unhiding initiated by i3bar itself).

For this to work, we would need the following:
(1) Like Axel said, we would need the possibility to react to keypress 
and keyrelease separately and would need to overload a key, so I could 
use windows-key as bar modifier and still use keybinding like windows+h.
(2) With the new event for sending barconfig updates, it would be easy 
to add a possibility to switch modes on the fly (also demanded in 
feature request #651). This would then make it possible, to switch to 
the new &quot;forcehide&quot; mode.

So the current hide-behaviour of i3bar using the barmodifier could be 
configured like this:
bindsym $mod bar show
bindsym --release $mod bar hide

The only difference here would be that the bar modifier would need to be 
specifically defined within a binding-mode. To me, this even sounds like 
the more consistent approach.

What do you think?

Best regards and thanks to you (and all contributors) for this wonderful wm
