Too bad I didn&#8217;t work earlier on j4menu since it was the main use case
for it. And I&#8217;m sad that you&#8217;re using &#8220;dmenu&#8221; everywhere while j4menu is
on its way. :'(


&gt;<i> You can read more about it in its documentation at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/tree/contrib/i3-dmenu-desktop?h=next#n375">http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/tree/contrib/i3-dmenu-desktop?h=next#n375</A>
</I>
You lack OnlyShowIn and NotShowIn support, at first sight. It might be
worth to support them if we start having so much i3 XDG support. :-)


&gt;<i> From the commit message:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See &quot;pod2man --utf8 contrib/i3-dmenu-desktop | man /dev/stdin&quot; for 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation. Use a line like this in your i3 config file: bindsym 
</I>&gt;<i> Mod1+p exec --no-startup-id ~/i3/contrib/i3-dmenu-desktop
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would love to hear your comments about this. Do you find it useful 
</I>&gt;<i> or not, and why?
</I>
Useful, sure, maybe a bit too limited for now (you can currently match
the name only, and some names does not match the exec name: &#8220;GNOME
Disks&#8221; vs &#8220;palimpsest&#8221;).
For the startup-notification support, would it be easy to tell i3 a
specific desktop on which you want to start the app, using e.g. &quot;exec
--on 1:web&quot;? I know you can already use &quot;workspace 1:web;exec;worspace
back_and_forth&quot;, but an alias might be enough (if it always works as
expected).


&gt;<i> I am toying with shipping this with i3 (as in: installing it on the 
</I>&gt;<i> system so that it ends up in packages) and making it the default 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of just using dmenu_run. Thoughts?
</I>
You would need to add a dep on dmenu then, or display some sort of
warning (nagbar?) to inform the user that it needs dmenu, at runtime.
And many users may find it&#8230; disappointing to change to default exec
behavior. Some i3-config-wizard setting maybe?


As a side note, I plan to push some j4menu useful code in January.
I will probably hack a j4menu-specific equivalent, as j4menu would
behave differently as dmenu.
This j4menu specific util will use Name, GenericName, Comment, Exec,
Keywords and maybe others to match the entry, and a tree menu based on
Categories.
In the hope that I&#8217;ll save you the maintenance time for this tool!


Cheers,
