I do the same from a somewhat more rudimentary zsh script. I just have
one line of sed to stuff names and commands in an associative array.

In practice, it has only rarely proved useful when the name from a
desktop file is more memorable than the command. It doesn't really work
for browsing the desktop menus because there's no structure.

The way I use dmenu is to only have one key bound to it and then I stuff
everything possible into the single menu. So anything with @ in it runs
a new terminal with ssh (or su) for the specified user and machine.
All commands in my path are prefixed with =. I can start/stop
schroot/virtual machines. I can rename my current workspace. What this
basically means is that I wouldn't use i3-dmenu-desktop because it only
does the desktop entries.

In terms of including it in the i3 distribution, I would consider
putting it in a directory named contrib. It really depends whether you'd
prefer packagers to install it in /usr/bin and add a dependency on dmenu
or put it under /usr/share/doc (or similar) and expect users to copy and
tweak it.

</I>
Testing your script on my system, it failed with the following error:
  Use of uninitialized value in split at ./i3-dmenu-desktop line 247.
After adding a little trace, this seems to be for a .desktop file that
contains a web link. There are Type=Link and URL= entries but no Exec=
