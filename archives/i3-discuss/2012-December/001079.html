<PRE>Hi Quentin,

Quentin Glidic &lt;<A HREF="http://infra.in.zekjur.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/i3-discuss">sardemff7+i3 at sardemff7.net</A>&gt; writes:
&gt;<i> Too bad I didn&#8217;t work earlier on j4menu since it was the main use case
</I>&gt;<i> for it. And I&#8217;m sad that you&#8217;re using &#8220;dmenu&#8221; everywhere while j4menu is
</I>&gt;<i> on its way. :'(
</I>As long as j4menu is not released _and in distributions_, I&#8217;m not gonna
depend on it within i3. That is, it will take many months until we are
there, even if you released a great version right now. The more
important new dependency that I need to force upon users is a recent
version of libxkbcommon.

&gt;<i> You lack OnlyShowIn and NotShowIn support, at first sight. It might be
</I>&gt;<i> worth to support them if we start having so much i3 XDG support. :-)
</I>Yes, I just display all entries for simplicity.

&gt;<i> Useful, sure, maybe a bit too limited for now (you can currently match
</I>&gt;<i> the name only, and some names does not match the exec name: &#8220;GNOME
</I>&gt;<i> Disks&#8221; vs &#8220;palimpsest&#8221;).
</I>True. I thought about adding a flag which allows switching between (or
using both) the &#8220;Name&#8221; and actual command. Does somebody else have an
opinion on that?

&gt;<i> For the startup-notification support, would it be easy to tell i3 a
</I>&gt;<i> specific desktop on which you want to start the app, using e.g. &quot;exec
</I>&gt;<i> --on 1:web&quot;? I know you can already use &quot;workspace 1:web;exec;worspace
</I>&gt;<i> back_and_forth&quot;, but an alias might be enough (if it always works as
</I>&gt;<i> expected).
</I>Theoretically, that should be possible.

&gt;<i> You would need to add a dep on dmenu then, or display some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> warning (nagbar?) to inform the user that it needs dmenu, at runtime.
</I>No, nothing changes in that regard. We currently ship with dmenu_run in
our default config, and we have a Recommends: suckless-tools in
Debian (which might translate into a dependency in other distributions).

&gt;<i> And many users may find it&#8230; disappointing to change to default exec
</I>&gt;<i> behavior. Some i3-config-wizard setting maybe?
</I>No, i3-config-wizard&#8217;s purpose is not configuring i3 for you. It
translates the keycodes to keysyms, and that&#8217;s it&#185;.

Can you elaborate on why users may find it disappointing?

&gt;<i> As a side note, I plan to push some j4menu useful code in January.
</I>&gt;<i> I will probably hack a j4menu-specific equivalent, as j4menu would
</I>&gt;<i> behave differently as dmenu.
</I>&gt;<i> This j4menu specific util will use Name, GenericName, Comment, Exec,
</I>&gt;<i> Keywords and maybe others to match the entry, and a tree menu based on
</I>&gt;<i> Categories.
</I>&gt;<i> In the hope that I&#8217;ll save you the maintenance time for this tool!
</I>Looking forward to it. More choice is always good. I expect this to
fully support UTF-8 so that we might switch to it instead of a
dmenu-based solution.

&#185; Yes, i3-config-wizard also allows modifier choice. I am not entirely
  decided on whether this was a good idea or not, but we need to keep
  &quot;Alt&quot; as the default modifier for people whose keyboards don&#8217;t have a
  windows key. At the same time, we really want to use the windows key
  to not clash with other keybindings. That&#8217;s the justification for
  having this choice in i3-c-w.

Best regards,
Michael
