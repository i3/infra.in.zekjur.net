This issue has become a lot worse recently, with many desktop files 
shipping with very long program names, especially as developers stop 
gnaming things knicely and xshortly.

This is a really big problem on SuSE, and probably on other distributions, 
and has been for a long time.  Since KDE3, KDE has a caching service 
(KSycoca) to handle desktop files, and it takes a long time to build.

There are 5157 .desktop files on the machine I am using now, though I 
think &quot;only&quot; about 924 are relevant.  How long does it take to parse 924 
files on a slow computer?  Probably not that long, but too long for a 
basic user interface element.

Also, although Pavel didn't mention it, there can be a lot of graphical 
applications that don't have .desktop files, at least in SuSE.  I will 
have to think of a clever way of counting these, but I guess the number 
in the base repositories is several hundred.  Maybe this is a packaging 
bug in SuSE, but it isn't going to be fixed soon.

This is not to be discouraging, of course; it is a very nice idea, I am 
just unsure about how to handle the issues above.
