<PRE>Hi,

<A HREF="http://infra.in.zekjur.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/i3-discuss">ml at hhecht.e4ward.com</A> writes:
&gt;<i> This issue has become a lot worse recently, with many desktop files 
</I>&gt;<i> shipping with very long program names, especially as developers stop 
</I>&gt;<i> gnaming things knicely and xshortly.
</I>I don&#8217;t really mind them using nice descriptive names, but as was
previously pointed out, some clearly should chose a better one, such as
GIMP. I have _never_ heard anyone in real life refer to GIMP as the &#8220;GNU
Image Manipulation Program&#8221;. Given that their GenericName is &#8220;Image
Editor&#8221; anyways, they could just rename to GIMP.

&gt;<i> There are 5157 .desktop files on the machine I am using now, though I 
</I>&gt;<i> think &quot;only&quot; about 924 are relevant.  How long does it take to parse 924 
</I>&gt;<i> files on a slow computer?  Probably not that long, but too long for a 
</I>&gt;<i> basic user interface element.
</I>I have 130 .desktop files within the relevant locations. Are your 5157
.desktop files in the 'applications' subfolder? If yes, how did you get
to 924 &#8220;relevant&#8221; and what does that mean?

I also don&#8217;t have numbers on how long it takes to parse them. On my
computer, launching i3-dmenu-desktop feels almost instant (so I guess
&#8776; 200 ms), but that&#8217;s a rather fast computer.

There&#8217;s all kinds of clever tricks one can do to make this faster, but
I want to wait with that until I got more feedback.

&gt;<i> Also, although Pavel didn't mention it, there can be a lot of graphical 
</I>&gt;<i> applications that don't have .desktop files, at least in SuSE.  I will 
</I>&gt;<i> have to think of a clever way of counting these, but I guess the number 
</I>&gt;<i> in the base repositories is several hundred.  Maybe this is a packaging 
</I>&gt;<i> bug in SuSE, but it isn't going to be fixed soon.
</I>You could try searching for all packages which have a dependency on
libX11 or Gtk/Qt. If they don&#8217;t have a .desktop file, how do users of
GNOME or KDE find/use these applications?
