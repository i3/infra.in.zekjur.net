<PRE>Hi everybody,

I just starting using i3 and I'm loving it. I owe a huge &quot;thank you&quot; to 
everybody involved!

I found out a similar discussion dating back in May 2010. One user asked 
whether it would be possible to move complete workspaces between monitors.

I would like to make it more generic by offering the possibility to move 
complete workspaces to other workspaces (be it on the same or a different 
monitor).

So, if I have two windows on workspace X, using a particular arrangement, I 
would like to be able to move both of them to workspace Y, while maintaining 
the arrangement (otherwise it is already possible to move windows one by one 
and rearrange them myself).

I think it would be a great feature, one that I miss almost every day  when 
using i3.

I'm puzzled though on what should be the proper behavior if the destination 
workspace is not empty. Perhaps a &quot;swap workspaces&quot; would make more sense? 
This could also double up as a &quot;rename workspace&quot; if the target workspace does 
not exist. Still requires some thinking...

Anyway, what I really wanted to ask is whether anybody is already working on 
this concept. If not, I would be more than willing to give it a try.

Also, anybody else thinks this would be useful?

Thanks again for this great WM,
Dimitris
