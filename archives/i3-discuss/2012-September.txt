First of all, I apologize for taking so long to comment on this patch.
I want to clearly point out why reviewing your patches is really hard
for me and what you can do to improve the situation.

The patch which you posted has multiple issues:

1) The commit title is absolutely meaningless. "make render_con logic
   more clearer" is a subjective thing. While it?s okay as a title, you
   absolutely need to provide a description consisting of the individual
   changes you have done. It would be even better if the individual
   changes were individual commits, but I don?t pose that as a
   requirement.

   An example for a good description would be:
   "Refactored identical code from render_x and render_y into new
   function render_xy_common(), no functional changes at all."

2) You introduce new unnecessary whitespace (first hunk,
   src/render.c:24).

3) You change our if (fullscreen) { ?; return; } block to if
   (!fullscreen){ /* other stuff */ } ?; without any obvious reason.
   Why? Returning early is good style and consistently used within i3.
   Also, we use blanks before brackets.

4) More importantly, you refactor two loops into one, but this breaks
   things! The first loop only cares for cons with ->type ==
   CT_DOCKAREA, the second one handles all cons.

5) I can?t really figure out what the rest of your changes do. They seem
   to move code around, but it?s not clear based on the diff. You really
   should provide an explanation and/or split it up into multiple
   smaller commits.

I also want to point out that similar comments have been made multiple
times before in your threads:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.i3.general/200
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.i3.general/343
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.i3.general/279

Why do you keep sending patches like these and don?t pay attention to
the things we point you to? This makes the whole reviewing and merging
workflow really hard :-/.

Best regards,
Michael

I apologize for the poor quality.
Thought this was a draft patch, I hadn't put time to refine this patch. But
I didn't realize this would cause so much difficulties in patch reviewing.
I really sorry for wasting your time.

Just out of curiosity: Why are there whitespaces after if () / for () but
not function definitions?

Because there possibly are popup windows. So we couldn't return so early.

There could only be one CT_CON. And that con is taken care of outside of
the loop.

No worries, I just hope we can be more productive together in the future
:-).

We use whitespace after control flow keywords (if, else, for, while,
return), but not between function calls or definitions. This is just a
matter of personal taste.

Aha. So the actual change (after reading your comment and the patch
again) is not calling the shortcut render_con(fullscreen); anymore, but
use render_con(ws); instead. If you hadn?t changed the structure, this
would have been much more obvious :-).

First of all, please adjust the comments, then (make it clear what your
assumptions are, so that people can react accordingly when they change
your assumptions). Also, outside the loop, you only set ->rect and call
render_con(), while the code previously also set ->deco_rect and called
x_raise_con(). I think your code thus changes behaviour in some cases.

Subject: [i3] Can't figure out a way to redirect screen session to workspace
Message-ID: <504755CF.1020300@tvk.rwth-aachen.de>

Hi guys,

I somehow can't figure out a way to make my mcabber screen session pop
up on workspace 2. Here is the part of my conf:

assign [class="Firefox"] 1
assign [title="[screen 0: mcabber] "] 2
assign [class="Thunderbird"] 3
exec firefox
exec jabmcab
exec thunderbird
exec --no-startup-id nitrogen --restore

And here is the xprop of the mcabber window:

WM_STATE(WM_STATE):
		window state: Normal
		icon window: 0x0
_NET_WM_PID(CARDINAL) = 11948
WM_PROTOCOLS(ATOM): protocols  WM_DELETE_WINDOW, _NET_WM_PING
WM_LOCALE_NAME(STRING) = "de_DE.utf8"
WM_CLASS(STRING) = "urxvt", "URxvt"
WM_HINTS(WM_HINTS):
		Client accepts input or input focus: True
		Initial state is Normal State.
		window id # of group leader: 0xa00009
WM_NORMAL_HINTS(WM_SIZE_HINTS):
		program specified minimum size: 12 by 18
		program specified resize increment: 8 by 14
		program specified base size: 4 by 4
		window gravity: NorthWest
WM_CLIENT_MACHINE(STRING) = "bla bla taken out"
WM_COMMAND(STRING) = { "urxvt", "-e", "zsh", "-c", "screen -rx mcabber
|| screen -S mcabber \\mcabber" }
_NET_WM_ICON_NAME(UTF8_STRING) = "zsh"
WM_ICON_NAME(STRING) = "zsh"
_NET_WM_NAME(UTF8_STRING) = "[screen 0: mcabber] "
WM_NAME(STRING) = "[screen 0: mcabber] "

Can you give me a little hint? If i leave out the whitespace in

assign [title="[screen 0: mcabber] "] 2

all my urxvt windows pop up on workspace 2.

Lukas

Hi,

doesn't work either. I think it is because it is a screen session.

Since you are starting urxvt with a special command for mcabber anyway,
the best way is to use:

    urxvt -name mcabber -e zsh ?

And use something like this in your config:

    assign [instance="^mcabber$"] 2

Subject: [i3] RFC: Ignoring size increment hints for tiling windows
Message-ID: <20120905154131.18527.89884@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

as many of you might have noticed, terminal emulators such as urxvt set
an X11 hint for getting resized only in increments of a specific size
(for example in increments of 13 px, if one line in your font size is 13
px high).

Oftentimes, the available space cannot be evenly divided by the resize
increment hint, and therefore you get little borders at the bottom or
right of a window.

Until now, we thought that this is just the way it is, but it turns out
that all terminal emulators I have tested (urxvt, xterm, gnome-terminal,
ROXterm) cope with whatever size one assigns them, that is, they still
work if i3 entirely ignores the size increment hint.

As I?ve mentioned in http://bugs.i3wm.org/query/ticket/540#comment:7,
Openbox ignores the size increment hint when windows are in fullscreen
for several years and that seems to work just fine.

Therefore, I?m announcing that we will ignore size increment hints for
tiling windows (NOT for floating windows such as GIMP toolbar windows)
in i3 4.3 UNLESS somebody has a good reason against that. In case you
have a good reason against it, please tell me/us ASAP.

In case you want to test whether your favorite terminal emulator still
works fine, apply ignore-size-increment-hints.patch (attached) and
check. In case you test one which was not mentioned in this thread
before, feel free to post your results.

Best regards,
Michael

I am using URxvt but had to post in appreciation. I just tried this
patch... Excellent! Now I can set some nice wallpaper and have URxvt
transparency without the "bars" thing.

Awesome. I am pretty much addicted to i3 now, everything else simply
doesn't feel right anymore :)

Thanks for such a cool WM!

I refined this patch and split it into four. Hope this time I've done it

Subject: [i3] [PATCH]remove unnecessary code in render_con().
Message-ID: <op.wj70c306h7z1jl@sraven>

The removed code was add by commit 61b8a62 to fix #564. That bug is cause
by rendering the mplayer window again as a floating window (even if it
has been rendered before as a fullscreen window, at line 202). So simply
checking for fullscreen window is enough to solve this problem. Treating
floating/tiling fullscreen window differently is not needed.

Hi,

I would like to release i3 4.3 soon?. Therefore, it?d be very helpful,
if you all could upgrade to the latest git version of the "next" branch.
The output of i3 --version should look like this if you did it right:

    i3 version 4.2-287-ga1823e5 (2012-09-06, branch "next")

This version is stable and can be considered a release-candidate.

Also, I will not merge new features into this version until the new
release is out. You can still send your patches and I will still review
them, they just won?t be merged immediately.

If you have any bugfix or ticket that you feel is important enough to be
included in this release, please speak up now and make me aware of it.

Thanks,
Best regards,
Michael

Done here (Debian package, on testing) :

jfs at jones:~$ i3 -v
i3 version 4.2-287-ga1823e5 (2012-09-06, branch "next") ? 2009-2012 Michael Stapelberg and contributors

It restarted (in place) smoothly and everything seems fine for now.

Many thanks to devs for the work !

Michael,

Is there a release notes for 4.3 version? That would help for testers to
funnel the focus on double-checking for issues...

Cheers,

Will the patch for Ignoring size increment hints for tiling windows be
included?  I note this git version does not include it, but you had
noted it as being part of the 4.3 release as per
http://bugs.i3wm.org/query/ticket/540.

Doesn?t that question answer itself? Since I already stated that it?ll
be included: yes, it will be included. I?m just waiting a bit for anyone
to come up with a valid objection.

I have not yet been able to build i3-4.3 on OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion).

I've attached one patch that works around "readlink -f" that does not
exist on OS X.  I think "pwd -P" does what we need, but I'm not
completly sure about it.  Comments welcome!

Other than that I see a couple of warnings and errors.  Since I won't be
able to look at these problems in detail in the next few days, I'll just
post them here:

Thanks, I?ve changed it in the makefile. Your patch didn?t apply at all
here, also I don?t even have the commit in the "From" line. Is your
working copy really tracking upstream or did it diverge sometime and you
merged it back together?

cmdparse is a file which doesn?t exist anymore in i3?s
code. Unfortunately, the makefile redesign removed it from the clean
target, which is why you are seeing these build errors. I pushed a fix
for that just now. Are there any errors left?

Subject: [i3] #784 bring open scratchpad window to the current workspace
Message-ID: <20120910183649.GA30325@finrod>

Hi. I didn't want to polute the bug report.

> Of course, this behavior should only be triggered when the

>> You mean because this way you cannot have more then one
>> scratchpad window opened at the same time?
>>> Yes.

>From the description of the scratchpad and the way I'm using it my reasoning
for this is following.
Since I cannot open more then one scratchpad window on a workspace, for having
more then one scratchpad window opened I need to move it around so I can treat
such windows as normal windows on the workspaces. The scratchpad for me is
simply a placeholder for stuff that runs in the background that I use for a
quick onetime task and put back again, such as a media player, IM etc. If I
need it for something permanent I simply include it in the workspace and when
I'm done I put it back. The way it is now it doesn't really make it simpler to
have more of those windows opened and still have it like a scratch pad.

If it is a viable way there could be a switch that would allow to configure i3
to act either in the current way or in the proposed so it doesn't force
everybody to confirm to the same way this feature is used. 
I would think this should only require modification of how the window that is
brought to the front gets selected so it might not be much of an invasion to
the current code but I can be mistaken.

I've upgraded using i3-git and i3status-git packages for Arch, from its AUR
and everything works well so far.
(I used packer script to perform the upgrade https://github.com/bruenig/packer)
I have noticed the startup is much faster.

Great work, thanks!

Hi all,

testing next for a few days. I noticed that for instance trying to resize 
a window which is alone on a workspace popups an error. Generally it
does any resizing in any invalid direction.

I've read the release notes. Basically i think it's a good idea to be
more responsive at runtime. But do we really want to be that strict?

I think it's annoying and the message shown in i3-nagbar is not much
helpful anyway. Maybe we can just work this out later and make it better
somehow.

Otherwise i can't complain about anything. Thanks to all of you for your 
great work i'm starting to be very pleased with i3.

Cheers,
Pavel

Yes, this point has been brought up on IRC, too. I suppose I will change
this behavior to only display i3-nagbar on parser errors (which are
roughly the same as configuration errors).

Maybe in the future we could instead send notifications (as in
freedesktop notifications) with the actual error message.

Hi,

I would really appreciate this, the new nagbar behaviour is nagging me.

Just to be sure you know about this:

You can use multiple windows in your scratchpad by defining distinct
shortcuts to bring them to the front. These shortcuts use criteria to
identify the precise window you want to see:

    bindsym Mod4+c [instance="cmus"] scratchpad show

This syntax is reserved for criteria, which don?t really work like
that. It strikes me that your particular feature might be best
implemented as an external script. See http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html

May I ask what's the meaning and intended usage of
[prefer-focused="yes"] ?

I don't see that statement in the docs.

You have misunderstood me: The syntax (square brackets) is reserved for
criteria. We do not intend to add anything else (such as an expression
of preference or general arguments for commands) in square brackets.

I use the method michael is recommending to have multiple Im windows pop up
on a single keystroke.  Works like a charm!

Message-ID: <CAKR2__2NqvQAt_sCCCVM3OOBvLneDaezk7J=zUomV_o9yqWF_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm trying to set up colors for i3status in i3bar mode, and for some
reason it fails to work.

My i3status config file looks like this:

$ cat -n .i3status.conf
     1 general {
     2  output_format = "i3bar"
     3  colors = true
     4  color_good = "#202020"
     5  color_degraded = "#e5871f"
     6  color_bad = "#c83839"
     7  interval = 10
     8 }
     9
    10 order  = "load"
    11 order += "time"
    12
    13 load {
    14  format = "L:%5min"
    15 }
    16
    17 time {
    18  format = "%H:%M ?"
    19 }

The color-related directives in my ~/.i3/config file look like this:

# -- colours -- #
#colourclass               border    backg.     text
client.focused             #1793D0   #1793D0    #FFFFFF
client.focused_inactive    #000000   #333333    #FFFFFF
client.unfocused           #000000   #333333    #FFFFFF
client.urgent              #FF0000   #FF0000    #FF0000

bar {
  status_command i3status
  colors {
    background #aeb2c3

But when I run i3status there are no color values in the JSON-formatted output:

,[{"name":"load","full_text":"L:0.08"},{"name":"time","full_text":"10:42 ?"}]
^C

Am I missing something in the configuration of i3status to actually
_send_ the colors to i3bar, like the example output in the manual of
i3bar?

I was expecting to see something like this instead, when colors = true:

$ i3status
{"version":1}

These two modules just don?t print out colors. Try it with something
like the ethernet, wireless or battery module (the latter only in latest
git).

Hi darkraven,

Thanks for updating the patches. The size of the patches is okay now.

In the second patch, you move rendering of the floating containers to
the CT_WORKSPACE level. I think this breaks rendering because floating
windows are then no longer guaranteed to always be on-top of tiling
windows in multi-monitor setups. Consider this case:

On the left 1024x768 output (let?s call it LVDS), I have workspace 1. On
that workspace, there is a floating window with size 200x100 pixels at
position (1000, 100).

On the right 1024x768 output (let?s call it VGA), I have workspace 2
with only tiling windows.

Now, your code will render LVDS first (and even if it doesn?t, we can
reverse the example) and raise floating windows. Then it will render VGA
and raise the tiling window above the floating window.

The comment at 
http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/tree/src/render.c?h=next#n237 tries to
express what I just described.

In the fourth patch, you have an indentation change for no apparent
reason (first few lines). Can you get rid of that please?

Message-ID: <CAELgYhehK8LCh5-j26abSDUMZ5BehP3aJ2u5aOpgUFB2Zb9DxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've a couple of questions related to floating mode.

First, when there are two floating windows one on top of another,
changing focus between them does not bring the lower one to the front
unless I click on it with the mouse. Is there any way to automatically
follow a 'change focus' action with a 'bring to front' action? I can't
find a command for the second one.

Second, what is the closest method to get a floating layout to an
entire workspace (and one that you can enable/disable dynamically)?

Best regards

No, since there is no such thing. People implement things they like
(after checking with us that it fits the philosophy) and fix things
which bother them. There?s a few feature requests in the bugtracker, so
that?s the closest you?ll get.

MIchael, thanks for your reply. I asked because you mentioned on my ticket
(#805) that 4.3 release date is very close and I couldn't find it anywhere.
Could you please share it with me?
Awesome job by the way. For a long time I've been trying out tiling wms
that faild in some way or the other. i3 has been like a breath of fresh
air. Simple, fast, elegant and so easy to configure it's almost ridculous.
I'm liking it so much I've been thinking about picking up C again and hack
some code for it :-)
To put it in one word: Thanks!

Best,
Marcos

I intend to release 4.3 tomorrow, unless a big blocker comes up.

Using git-archive is not a supported way of building i3 and never has
been. If you want to build outside of git, use 'make dist' and build the
resulting tarball. Otherwise, just build within your git working copy.

Subject: [i3] building 4.3 on RHEL 6
Message-ID: <15732.1348107506@thecus.kiddle.eu>

I had a few issues building the latest i3.

It seems cairo has been built without xcb support or at least
cairo/cairo-xcb.h was not found. I worked around this by disabling pango
which is easy enough. My Debian system has a cairo-xcb.pc file so it
should be possible to make that automatic if it is the most appropriate
workaround.

The next problem was with ev.h not being found when compiling i3-msg,
i3-nagbar, i3-config-wizard and i3-input. $(LIBEV_CFLAGS) was missing
from their Makefiles and ev.h is in /usr/include/libev (it presumably
works by accident on Debian because there it is just /usr/include/ev.h).
However, it looks to me like these #includes are superfluous and the
correct fix is simply to remove them as per the patch below.

Finally, the trickiest problem is that yajl_get_bytes_consumed() was
introduced with yajl 1.0.8 and RHEL 6 includes yajl 1.0.7. The relevant
call was introduced in commit e53405c2 and it seemed fairly safe to
apply that whole change in reverse.

This is hard....
The solution I come up with is quite ugly, don't know if you would like it.

The fourth patch is now dropped from this patch series. I think it's a bit

No, we will NOT make this automatic. Pango support is an important
feature of i3 and if you decide to rip it out, you should really do that
in a concious way.

Note that this change is important for third-party scripts. Removing it
is only fine as long as you don?t share that package. If you intend to
package an RPM and distribute it, please find a different solution, for
example statically linking yajl 1.0.8 (also, I hate how yajl <2 didn?t
bring a pkg-config file, so we can?t automatically check for the
presence of this function).

Hi Oliver,

I've compiled the latest i3 version from git (next branch) for rhel 6.3
without any changes. Although I had to compile some deps from source. For
example, for yajl I updated the SRPM package to 1.0.8 and rebuilt the
package.

Regards,
Marcelo

There are two different things that are commonly done with
floating windows that get focused:

  - When focused by mouse _click_ events, raise immediately
  - When focused by mouse movement, _maybe_ raise after a timeout
(commonly called raise_on_focus)

This is currently not supported AFAIK, but if you're interested in
writing a patch, please do it :-)

i3 does this already.

A timeout would feel weird and not fit i3?s look&feel well.

As I said, it is. Carlos is talking changing focus via keyboard, not
via mouse.

Patch welcome. I think raising a floating window on focus should be the
default action, so no new configuration directives are required.

>> Second, what is the closest method to get a floating layout to an

I?m not sure what exactly you mean by that. Making all windows on one
workspace floating is not supported, also marking workspaces as
floating-by-default is not supported. i3 is primarily a tiling window
manager, floating windows are only for popup windows.

Hello Michael,

Would it be possible to add a 2px border mode to i3? I don't want my
windows to have a title bar but the 1pixel-mode is _way_ too thin on my new
15" 1920x1200 laptop display.

Ciao, Marcus

I was planning on rolling a patch to cover border width as a configuration parameter. I already have a personal one for a gap between windows that I'd be willing to release if anyone else is interested in that.

I thought this could be a good starting point for me to start looking at
i3's code. So I decided to code a patch for this. The only thing is that I
did add a new configuration option "raise_on_focus" because I don't want
that to be my default behavior.
Should I create a ticket and attach my patch to it?

Here's the patch

Why? What?s the rationale in focusing floating windows without raising
them?

> Should I create a ticket and attach my patch to it?
No, as long as I get the patch via mail, there?s no need to create a
ticket.

Giorgos: Since you didn?t let the mailing list know that you were
working on this, too, there was some unfortunate duplication of
work. Anyway, the reason why your code didn?t work was most likely
because you raised the container *within* its surrounding floating
container, which effectively has no effect. Instead ? as Macros did ?
one should use floating_raise_con().

I believe my last message was filtered by its size, so here it goes again:
Michael,
Sometimes a floating windows fits inside another floating window (see here
http://imageshack.us/a/img402/650/floatingwindows.png ) and if I change the
focus from the top window to any of the other two, the one that was on top
is now gone. The only way for me to access it is by moving the newly raised
window to another location. If you use a small floating window on a regular
basis, like I do with a screen ruler, and use other floating windows from
time to time, this behavior can get a bit annoying.
I still think it should be the default behavior (and I'm using it that
way). I just want a way to switch it off if I want to.

Best Rgds,
Marcos

Hi,

I am currently working on a fitting code review board for i3 with
django. You can see the progress at http://ablepharus.eu/rb/  .

To improve usability, the board needs some javascripts, I won't find the
time to write them.

So I am asking, who could help me by providing a couple of scripts?

The first one I need involves inserting a form in the middle of the page
and partially filling it.


If you have questions you can ask via email or jabber <ablepharus at ignaz.org>

best regards

It would make more sense to me to have a hotkey bound to something that would "unraise" the focused window (read: send to back). Just a thought.

How would that differ from sending the window to the scratchpad?

Uh.... Sending the window to the scratchpad hides it completely until you show the scratchpad.  "Unraise" would just effectively raise every window behind the focused window without changing focus.  It feels better than a new config option to me, and allows the user to choose how floating windows to behave at runtime.

This is your mistake. Using floating windows on a regular basis is wrong
when using i3. Floating windows are an after-thought, a necessary evil
for handling popup dialogs in a somewhat acceptable fashion. They are
not an equal alternative to using tiling windows, they were never
intended to and they never will be :-).

I?m not convinced that increasing complexity (mainly mental complexity
for people to understand their choice when reading through the
userguide) by adding the option you propose is worth the benefit.

I?d argue that when you switch to a floating window with your keyboard,
you want to see and use that window, so i3 should raise it.

Message-ID: <50637C3F.9050900@in.tum.de>

Hi list!

For presentations it would be really nice if only specified workspaces
are cloned over both monitors. Is that possible somehow?

I know that this could be complicated, as the monitors only display
sections of the X Display.

Anyhow, having private workspaces on my laptop only and projector shared
workspaces would be awesome.

Thanks for any pointers.


Cheers,

JJ

Enough said. I'll remove the option and work on a new patch were not only
that is the default behavior, but also the same thing happens when
switching floating windows with the keyword (my current patch doesn't
handle that at the moment).
Thanks for input.

Subject: [i3] "another container"
Message-ID: <20120926221532.GA7787@scanner>


Hey Folks!

I'm new here, hope not to be an annoyance with this first post...

I was initially going to ask whether there was a way to configure
the default description of named containers; but then I searched
and saw that there was/is a patch and a ticket in your trac system.

So it looks like it's just a matter of time before a better 
default lable for displayed containers appears - next stable 
release of i3?

Well, before seeing that there was this patch, I simpy wanted to
configure the container descriptions to be null... seeing as no
description whatsoever is just as useful as everyone have being
labled as "another container".

So, if this was enough of a mild aesthetic issue for me, could I
just modify the appropriate line in .../src/x.c of the source to:

draw_text_ascii("")

...?  

Or should I just pull from git and run with the current changeset?
( I'm looking at http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/commit?id=1806c980 -
could someone translate what the new default lable looks like when
displayed? )


Thanks!

( By the way, I'm really digging i3 - first time using a tiling wm,
still kinda getting the hang of things, but I like it! )

Hi eeno,

knopwob has written a patch for that which is merged in the current
development version of i3 (git "next" branch). Feel free to use that in
order to get better descriptions.

No. X11 does not know about workspaces, they are just an abstraction
provided by the window manager.

The only way to address this (without using a compositing window
manager) is to not clone your monitors but let your presentation
application open two different windows, one which you place on your
output and one which you place on the output which your audience sees.

Thats good to hear, help is always appreciated. But most important is
someone who
can write a couple of javascript to improve usability, are you familiar
with that to?


I will publish the code and installation instructions soon, to allow
contribution.

I am interested in both of these, especially the gap patch if it is already
finished. I'm not even sure if I would use it in my default setup or not,
but I like how it looks in other tiling WMs. If it makes it easier to see
which window has focus (without using title bars, which deeply annoy me--I
can recognize my apps on sight and everything is already organized in a
consistent way) then I can definitely see using it all the time.

No. GitHub (while being a cool company with a good product) is
proprietary. I cannot host their review software on my own
server, thus using GitHub for code reviews is a vendor lock-in.

I want to avoid such a vendor lock-in for several reasons:

1) Building free software should not depend on closed-source
   software. I?m not saying this in a _very_ religios fashion such as
   rms (who?d argue that my server?s BIOS is probably unfree), but it
   seems reasonable to avoid closed-source if we can reasonably live
   without it. We?ve seen what happened with BitKeeper and the Linux
   kernel.

2) If we want to improve the code review workflow in some detail, we
   cannot do it. Unless GitHub is friendly enough to do it, if it makes
   sense for them at all. This is the major reason why I switched to a
   FOSS operating system and software. Similarly, they have the option
   of modifying the software as they see fit, without asking us first
   and without an alternative for us.

3) GitHub requires an account to submit a pull request. This is
   reasonable from GitHub?s point of view but unacceptable from ours. No
   account creation barriers to reporting bugs and sending improvements
   has been one of our principles since the very beginning of the
   project.

4) With using GitHub for reviews, we effectively have to use GitHub for
   our git repository. Otherwise we?d have to mirror it, but having two
   copies which might be out of sync is stupid, so we?d have to push to
   both locations. GitHub (in my daily life) is slow. And sometimes it?s
   down. My own server is much more reliable for our little
   project. Also, it seems wise to avoid a central point-of-failure and
   encourage a distributed system (many git servers instead of every
   FOSS project on GitHub).

[snip] 

The solution I've adopted for this problem is to launch a second window
manager (icewm in my case) in a different terminal. I run a little
script to do this: 
		
		xinit  /home/ac/.xxinitrc -- :1 &

where .xxinitrc is used to start icewm. I can then switch back and forth
with Shift-Alt-F8 and Shift-Alt-F7. I got this idea from ratpoison,
which has an option to do this.

Looks like I was beaten to the border width; it's now a config parameter on
the next branch.

The gap patch is just an "it looks nice" thing for me, though I can see how
it would help to have window borders contrast with a desktop background.
 I'll make the width configurable and post the patch to the mailing list.

I'm quite new on linux, and BitKeeper is long gone before I even heard of
linux, so I could be wrong on this. But for what I understand, it's
religious people like RMS who forced linux and BitKeeper to part ways, not
BitKeeper's being proprietary limited the development of kernel.

Imagine I switched to linux distributions from Windows, and change it to
look&behave exactly the same as Windows, then why would I make the change?
If you not really have a better idea, why not just use the existing
solution, even if it's closed?
I don't know you, maybe you have a definitely better idea of how a code
reviewing system should be than GitHub. But if not, why not using GitHub
for now, and when you eventually feel the itch to make changes, you could
start making your own. And by that time, what you make will definitely  be
better.
Oops, this sounds like persuading. Anyway, I'm just using GitHub as an
example to make my point.

This could be a problem. But GitHub is not dedicated to i3, so people who

My perception of "distribution" is a bit different as yours. I think being
distributed means every one who clone the repo have complete history of the
repo. So have one *more* clone on GitHub won't harm this kind of
distribution at all.
There are no two copies of one repo, there are two different branches which
could pull from each other. I think out-of-sync would be too big a problem.
And the network problem is a matter of view point. GitHub might be slow for
you, but faster for someone else, and your server might be fast for you,
but slow for someone else.

FUD. If you really think that Torvalds gives any such degree of credence to
RMS, then ask him why he never says GNU/Linux.

BitKeeper stopped offering their proprietary product free of charge, plain
and simple. It's use was always a bit controversial, but no one who had
supported using BitKeeper despite license concerns could really argue that
their position had been the most sane to begin with.

No, I think you got that wrong:

I will not go into this discussion. I think I made my point clear
enough in my previous mail.

I don?t, GitHub?s review workflow is pretty good.

And people who wight mant to contribute to i3 might be very opposed to
getting a GitHub account.

I already mentioned that having an inferior clone on github sucks, and
caring about an up-to-date clone sucks even more.

Yes, but since I push all changes to i3, it matters if it?s fast for
me, not for anyone else.

Michael,
Sometimes a floating windows fits inside another floating window (see
attachment for an example) and if I change the focus from the top window to
any of the other two, the one that was on top is now gone. The only way for
me to access it is by moving the newly raised window to another location.
If you use a small floating window on a regular basis, like I do with a
screen ruler, and use other floating windows from time to time, this
behavior can get a bit annoying.
I still think it should be the default behavior (and I'm using it that
way). I just want a way to switch it off if I want to.

Best Rgds,

This works perfectly fine here.

Hi Marcos,

I misread your patch previously: Raising a floating window when you
focus it with the mouse is not wanted behavior (and we don?t want an
option for that either, since you can just click and/or use the
keyboard).

I merged raise on keyboard focus change for floating windows in commit
http://c.i3wm.org/064be457. Was there a special reason why you used
con_inside_floating(next) instead of just next (which is a floating
container already)?

yes, a previous double check to con_is_floating(next) always returned False
even though next is floating. Still, raising next does the trick.

Subject: [i3] RFC: http://bugs-beta.i3wm.org/ (new ticket form)
Message-ID: <x6mx0b4laq.fsf@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

Good news everyone! I improved our new ticket form.

Have a look at http://bugs-beta.i3wm.org/ (you can play with it all you
want, but please don?t hit "Submit" in step 4 unless you have a real
issue to submit).

It?s a small web-app which asks you a few concise and helpful (for us)
questions. After you answered them all, the ticket will be created in
our trac. The intention is to reduce the amount of round-trips for
tickets caused by questions such as "can you reproduce this with a
recent version of i3?" and "can you please attach a debug
logfile?". Also, the form encourages people to specify their email
address and explains why that?s useful (because we otherwise have to
close the ticket if you don?t respond within 6 weeks).

Any comments and feedback is welcome. If everything works out fine, I?ll
make this the default new ticket form. Please use it when submitting
issues from now on.

BTW: Of course this is not final. I have a few more improvements in the
back of my head once we got this working well, like as-you-type
duplicate search (in tickets, commits, FAQ) or automatic logfile
cleaning/analysis.

Subject: [i3] Access i3bar tray with keyboard?
Message-ID: <5066BC3C.2050906@gmx.net>

Hello,

is it possible to access the i3bar tray with the keyboard?

Because sometimes I feel very lazy and don't want to move the mouse over
the hole screen (e.g.) to right click nm-applet.
So I wonder, if this is possible.

Have a nice day.
Jean

Not in an easy way. The applications render and handle the tray area
themselves, i3bar merely embeds their windows.
