I3-with-shmlog is indeed the process to attach to. I started i3 clean, and then as root I was able to attach to this process. For some reason, though i3 is running as ubuntu, I was not able to attach as ubuntu. Once attached, I then initiated the sequence of events that I expected to crash i3, the crash did indeed occur (so this is quite repeatable).

I'll continue to see if I can isolate other crash points.

I'll post a bug on the bug tracker to ensure that this hits Michael's radar.

Subject: i3 4.10.2 crash

I3 4.10.2 has crashed on me. I've seen crashes before but have ignored them. I'm interested in seeing if I can isolate the crash, particularly since I think I know how to repeat the crash. Once isolated I can provide feedback to the dev team.

I am currently presented with the &quot;crash response window&quot; (red border with options to: attach gdb, save a backtracke, restart i3 in place, forget the current layout and restart i3).

When I putty into the box and see what i3 processes are running (with an eye towards attaching gdb), I see the following:

ubuntu    6031  6005  0 12:12 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto i3


The area that I built i3 out of is:  /home/ubuntu/work/i3/i3-4.10.2

This is where I should be able to find the source code and symbol files required by gdb.

I've attached gdb to debuggable processes in the past (I don't need help with that). I do need some guidance relative to the following questions:
1] If I save a backtrace, where will that get saved on the system
2] Of the processes listed above, which one do I attach to (I don't see i3.. perhaps i3-with-shmlog)?
3] What are the commands that I should enter into gdb so that it loads the proper symbol files?

Thanks for any thoughts or guidance.
