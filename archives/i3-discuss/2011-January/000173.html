<PRE>Thanks guys,

Yeah, I saw that, and it looked like it might work, but what made me see if there was something better was this:

mode &quot;resize&quot; {
   ...
   bind 36 mode default
}

Which you've confirmed below... you're kinda &quot;stuck&quot; there until you explicitly get out, as opposed to just executing the command and being done after it executes.  However, this looks like it'll do alright.

Thanks a lot,
Derek

P.S. Would there be any plan to add this in the future?  I may hack at it, but it would be at work, and I'd have to fly it by legal :)

Hi Derek,

Excerpts from Derek Wyatt's message of 2011-01-25 17:51:01 +0100:
&gt;<i> This gives me more of that &quot;vim feeling&quot; where I can do things like: 'map ,of
</I>&gt;<i> :call ...', so I'm not holding down Shift+Mod1+Contro+k or whatever... Does
</I>&gt;<i> anyone know if this is possible or if there's some other feature that can
</I>&gt;<i> mimic this, or even do better?
</I>This is possible using modes, see for example [1] or take the following (untested) example:

  mode &quot;leader&quot; {
    bindsym t exec /usr/bin/urxvt
    bindsym b exec /usr/bin/firefox
    bindsym Enter mode default
  }
  
  bindsym Mod1+a mode leader

Please note that there is no concept of a timeout (so when pressing Mod1+a and
then pressing nothing, you are still stuck in the leader mode and need to press
Enter to get out of it). Also, there is no visual indication about modes at the
moment.

Best regards,
Michael
