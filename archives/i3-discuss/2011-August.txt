Hi I'm really sorry if it's a double mail, but I'm not really sure if
my previous email has been sent.

Hi Michael and others,

Thanks for the new release. Are there any specific build instructions
for 4.0. I'm trying to compile it on Slackware64 13.37. I just enter
'make' and that's what I get:

Hi Marcin,

The problem has been reported on IRC and will be adressed in a new minor
release soon. Until then, you can fix this issue by adding the following line
in i3bar/Makefile before the 'all: i3bar doc' line:

CFLAGS += -I$(TOPDIR)/../include

Best regards,
Michael

Thank you Michael. Unfortunately it hasn't helped. The error hasn't
disappeared. I removed the old sources and downloaded the tarball
again. The i3-4.0/i3bar/Makefile is as follows:
TOPDIR=$(shell pwd)

include $(TOPDIR)/common.mk

FILES:=$(wildcard src/*.c)
FILES:=$(FILES:.c=.o)
HEADERS:=$(wildcard include/*.h)
FCLAGS+=-l$(TOPDIR)/../include
all: i3bar doc

When I 'make clean' after the error, I get the following:

Just a correction. Obviously I've got a typo there. It's supposed to
be CFLAGS instead of FCLAGS. I've corrected it and now I've got the
following error:

Hi Marcin,

Debugging this on a mailing list is tedious. Can you come to #i3 on IRC?

In any case, check out the current next branch, where the build problems should
be fixed:

  git clone -b next git://code.i3wm.org/i3

Best regards,
Michael

Thanks Michael,

The next branch compiled without any problems. I'm using it now. I'll
try to migrate my dzen2 config to the new version. If I have any
problems with it I'm going to join #i3.

Thanks

Sure. Assuming your workspace starts in horizontal orientation (if width >
height):

 ? Open a terminal, open another one
 ? Split the right terminal vertically (mod1+v)
 ??Open another terminal 
 ? Change layout to tabbed
 ? Split the left terminal vertically
 ? Open another terminal

Message-ID: <CAKneAX=zFcE+y1kGnQthc9XNOXHk5wMFCivLk1S3cx6YYcsxWg@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

on i3-3 i used to my dzen2 bar,
while sleep 1s; do
  echo -n $(hostname);
  echo -n " | ";
  echo $(date);
done | dzen2

using the i3bar, it displays only the last echo output
while sleep 1s; do
  echo -n $(hostname);
  echo -n " | ";
  echo $(date);
done | i3bar -d

is this some feature, or bug? :)
i would expect i3bar to display the whole line, because there is a pipe

thx

This is a bug, kind of. We did not get around to fixing it yet, though.

> while sleep 1s; do

You can fix it like this:
    echo "$(hostname) | $(date)"
(or buffer whatever you are doing before and just use one single echo)

Michael

I don?t get what you mean. The command is exactly as described above in the

hi,

the documentation says: 'split vertical'
but the right way is: 'bindsym mod+v split vertical'

all the other commands are introduced with the 'bindsym' pre-command,
so this is quite a bit misleading

Thanks for the patch. I don?t want to merge it however, since I think it?s
rather hackish. The ev-manpage explicitly discourages blocking mode and I think
using blocking read within a callback is bad.

i3bar will gain JSON input support soon and \n-termination won?t be an issue
anymore, then. I think the best strategy is to wait for the JSON support.

Michael

Message-ID: <CAKneAXmFpU8Zi9adS9nhPLimiCyuhQhwu2+ZDtro-VvmcxiETA@mail.gmail.com>

hi,

there is a bug in the documentation
http://i3wm.org/docs/4.0/userguide.html#resizingconfig

in "Example:" section (wrong):
=====
bindsym k resize grow bottom
bindsym Shift+k resize shrink bottom

bindsym l resize shrink top
bindsym Shift+l resize grow top
...
bindcode 36 mode default
=====

a correct version according to the i3 log should be:
=====
bindsym k resize grow down
bindsym Shift+k resize shrink down

bindsym l resize shrink up
bindsym Shift+l resize grow up
...
bindcode 36 mode "default"
=====

Message-ID: <CALfxriKCyWG47DsRNF87RJToUiy6itTwF-nwFSPfMF1vT9mTQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello List,

I have a problem getting i3 to run on my desktop computer. As it says
in the subject, i3 exits with the message "Could not get geometry of
the root window, exiting" and then X crashes.

Setup:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- NVidia GeForce 6800 with latest drivers (280.13)
- 19" Monitor and a TV connected to the computer
- i3 "next" branch from git
- Twinview or seperate X screens - it doesn't matter, the error is
always the same
- starting i3 with or without "--force-xinerama" doesn't change anything either
- other window managers (blackbox, xfwm4) do work
- on my Laptop with ATI Mobility Radeon 9700, everything works fine,
even when connecting the same Monitor and configuring dual head via
xrandr

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Ciao, Marcus

For the record: We fixed this by uninstalling xfs. X also crashed when opening
xfontsel within a GNOME session, so it was not an i3 bug.

I fact, every application using X core fonts (the ugly ones) crashed
(I tried xclock to verify). As Micheal said, uninstalling the xfs font
server fixed this for me,

Michael, thanks again for your assistance.

PS: XFT support for i3 would still be great. ;-)

Hey guys,

are there any experience of using i3 with a remote desktop software?
I tried tightvnc some time ago and I didn't get the keyboard control to
work.
At the moment I actually don't have the time to try harder but I think
that it would be nice if some remote control would work.

hi again,

i've made some some other progress in the "floating windows edge
snapping" feature

now, the windows are snapping while moving and while resizing

i've also pushed the new configuration option into the config file
determining the edge snap threshold

if interested, download the patch here
http://home.zcu.cz/~honza801/i3-4.0.1-master-snap_floating_windows.diff

it is ready to be merged with the master branch

enjoy
fous

Hi Sebastian,

Since nobody replied, I?ll reply without knowing much about the subject, though
:).

Excerpts from Sebastian Heupts's message of 2011-08-24 20:01:51 +0200:

I know of some people who use i3 with some VNC software.

It?s always a good idea to look at http://i3wm.org/docs/4.0/debugging.html and
enable the logfile. Maybe that tells you what?s wrong.

Things you should verify in any case: Which keyboard shortcut(s) did you try?
If it was Mod+Enter, do you actually have the configured terminal emulator
installed on your system? If you use Debian, this should not be an issue, as it
uses x-terminal-emulator and has a proper dependency. i3?s default config in
!Debian uses urxvt, though (sometimes called rxvt-unicode in distributions), so
make sure you have that installed or you appropriately modified your config.

Best regards,
Michael

Subject: [i3] i3-input command building
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.00.1108271935480.5936@juffo-wup.dyndns.org>

I discovered i3 a day or so ago, and have a number of questions that don't 
seem to be covered in the documentation.  I don't know if the readers of 
the list would prefer one email per question or otherwise, so I'll just 
start with the most immediate:

i3-input accepts a -p argument as a prefix to a command, but does not seem 
to allow one to have a suffix to what is read; is this correct?  The 
motivation is to build a goto-by-class binding:
i3-input -p '[class=' -P 'Goto :' '] focus'

but it seems that it ignores anything in argv not in the getopt loop, 
leaving no way to build a command where the "interesting" part does not 
occur at the end.  An equivalent example is found in section 5.7 of the 
user guide ("VIM-like marks (mark/goto)"): there appears to be no way to 
actually implement this functionality with i3-input, which is recommended 
for the task.  One could, of course, enter the whole command with 
i3-input, or just append "] focus" oneself, but this seems unnecessarily 
tedious: hardly a timesaver.

Is it better to just ignore i3-input and write a shell script around 
i3-msg and xdialog?

Subject: [i3] pan icon in display
Message-ID: <20110828212423.GC6684@poincare.pc.linmpi.mpg.de>

The pan icon in Imagemagick's display should appear only when the size
of the image is largen than the screen. However in i3 the panning icon
also appears when the image is smaller than the screen.  Please find
attached the relevant part of my logfile with verbose output. Another
perhaps unrelated problem is that display opens the image with
coordinates 640,640 by default in i3 so in this example I have used
'display -geometry +0+0' to center the image.

Miguel
