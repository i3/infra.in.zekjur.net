<PRE>Hi Jeff,
I think what you need is the concept of a container (what you call a
frame). You can create a container before you create a window, e.g.,
mod-H or mod-V for horizontal or vertical splits, and then add the
window in there. The creation of the container is silent until you
actually place a new window in it, but when you do that the new window
only resizes those that already exist in the container, without
affecting size or position of other containers.. I think this is
explained in one of the videos.

Best,
S

</I>&gt;<i> all windows are in tabbed mode, then new windows don't cause resizes.)  This

</I>&gt;<i> To my mind, this arises because i3 conflates frames with windows.  A frame
</I>&gt;<i> is the thing that partitions screen space.  In a frame I can put one or more
</I>&gt;<i> windows.  Of course, each frame might have precisely one window, the current
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour.  But what I am doing is essentially creating frames and then
</I>&gt;<i> expecting new windows to conform to those frames.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I'm curious how others see this.
