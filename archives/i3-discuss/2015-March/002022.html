Technically, maybe, but by all appearances, no. The container doesn't really
seem to exist until the window occupies it. However, any time you create a split
of some sort i3 will be primed to draw a container to the right of or below the
newly split window and open a window within it.

I typically work with two or three separate containers per workspace, usually
starting out stacked and changing the layout in each as necessary. Give this a
try: 

1. Open up your configuration file and add (or change) the setting
   'workspace_layout tabbed'

2. Reload, then start with an empty workspace.

3. *Do not* hit mod-H, and instead just open two terminal windows. They'll be
   tabbed in a single container by default.

4. Now move one of them left or right, thereby moving it into its own container,
   and start playing around. You should get a feel for how things are working
   pretty quickly. Once you do, you can move into other realms.
