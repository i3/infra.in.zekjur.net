<PRE>I've been using i3 for several weeks now on most of my machines [1].  It's
very nice, many thanks to all who have made it work so well.

I find one concept confusingly conflated, and I am curious how others see
it, and if I am simply missing some bit of mental model.  It often happens
that I open several windows, adjust their sizes (for example, some
monitoring plots wide and short, an editor tall, etc.  But if I open a new
window, it changes the sizes I've set. To get around this, I typically set
up windows as I'd like them, then change each window in turn between
vertical and horizontal mode to force creation of a new container, then put
the window into tabbed mode so that new windows don't change its size. (If
all windows are in tabbed mode, then new windows don't cause resizes.)
This achieves what I want, but seems a bit long-winded.

To my mind, this arises because i3 conflates frames with windows.  A frame
is the thing that partitions screen space.  In a frame I can put one or
more windows.  Of course, each frame might have precisely one window, the
current behaviour.  But what I am doing is essentially creating frames and
then expecting new windows to conform to those frames.

Anyway, I'm curious how others see this.
