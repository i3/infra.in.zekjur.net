<PRE>Hello!

I've been using i3wm for a little over a year.  Recently I've been using
the Tabs feature, grouping several terminal windows in different tabs
(monitoring a dozen or so logs).  I have my .bash environment set the
Window Title properly for terminals, and that works with single tabs -
displaying the gnome-terminal's title in the Tab's title just like it
should.

&quot;Single Tabs&quot; meaning with only 1 process running within that tab, i3wm
shows the Window Title of that one process.  E.g. my gnome-terminal's
window title.

This message is about tabs that have multiple processes running within the
tab's i3wm container.  E.g. two or more terminal windows.  i3wm currently
displays in the window title of the tab:

    i3: H[gnome-terminal gnome-terminal]

It is obviously showing the process name, and that I am split via Height.
Cool, but I am missing the Window Title I have set in the terminals.
Again, the Tab's Window Title normally displays the Window Title of the
executing process.  It's when grouping multiple processes within a single
tab.

I think the &quot;H&quot; and &quot;V&quot; is fine. I get things like this:

    i3: H[V[gnome-terminal gnome-terminal] V[gnome-terminal gnome-terminal]]

That obviously says I have a 2x2 arrangement in that tab.  It would really
nice if it showed the Window Title of those processes though.  For example,
if the terminal has the current path set for Window Title, it would look
like:

    i3: H[V[&quot;~/code/sp-validator&quot; &quot;~/code/sp-juke&quot;] V[&quot;~/go/src/
github.com/eduncan911/go-mspec&quot; &quot;~/&quot;]]

Now, you'll notice I put in quotations. An additional tweak may be to put
in some type of delimier for when titles have spaces - so we know the
different in a title like this:

    i3: H[Evolution Inbox ~/code/sp-validator:grep]

^- That's two different apps running in horizonal split view.  Without
quotes around &quot;Evolution Inbox&quot;, it would hard to determine where the first
one ends and second begins.

Just a suggestion to an awesome window manager!

Thanks!
Eric
