Message-ID: <150228a0db8.120c5d6fb467.2524676750396045260@web.de>



Hey there,



I am having some problems getting wifi to work in i3. I tried to add



exec--no-startup-id nm-applet
to my config and this braught me the icon, but it can not find any wifi networks.

It seems that there are some problems with the session or similar. I also tried wicd or gnome-network-manager all without results. 



I am using Ubuntu 15.04 and i3 4.10.4.



Any ideas?

The window manager is neither responsible nor involved in network
management at all, so I'm afraid you're looking in the wrong direction here.

I have the following in my ~/.xsessionrc, and it works correctly:

    nm-applet &

Subject: [i3] Mouse capture problem i3 and OBS
Message-ID: <CACuV5sD_iH9Ce+=uidsj=4nd0h0PedSdfozVjg+cqu-T910ANA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Having problem with redundant mouse capture in OBS running with i3-wm.

When the mouse is moved to change some recording settings in the OBS
interface at the bottom or in the canvas, the mouse movement for those
modifications gets displayed in the canvas and gets recorded in the
final input, even when there is no source of screen capture of the
machine in which OBS is running.

This problem is only when in the tabbed mode, but not in the tiling
mode of i3-wm. By changing the tabbed mode ($MOD+w) to tiling mode
($MOD+e), the mouse movements for OBS settings modifications
disappears and that is what actually desired.

Posted a bug report to OBS guys:
https://obsproject.com/mantis/view.php?id=340 and posting here if that
has to anything with i3-wm?

Thanks!

Have you tried reproducing this problem with any other window manager that
offers a tabbed mode?

I use wicd instead of NetworkManager and I'm very happy with it. It
would connect as soon as I login in text mode, so by the time I3 is up,
the connection is already there.

I use wicd with i3, but it always fails when I attempt to connect to a network
that requires authentication (virtually all of them, these days).  There's some
error in the Python code that I have tracked down yet, so I log into new
networks with nm-applet the first time, then with wicd thereafter.

Subject: [i3] Killing a window's process
Message-ID: <CAM4Y7zzrLiZ-TLB05-z8RwogLNy-FMSt5_K8Ymo6q9y6qrbHUQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have a window whose process is not responding.  No problem, i3 lets me
kill windows, so I type that key combination.  Usually it works, but this
time it doesn't.

My work-around is to use wininfo to find the window id of the dead but
mapped thing, bc to convert to decimal, use "ps aeww | grep" to find the
process with that window id in its environment, then send it a kill -15
(does nothing visible) and then a kill -9 (still mapped, but process now
shows as defunct).


So the* problem* (obviously not critical, since I have a work-around) is
how could I have avoided the wininfo -> ps -> bc -> kill thing.  Looking at
the code, it looks like i3's kill window is cmd_kill
<https://github.com/i3/i3/blob/next/src/commands.c#L1298>() in commands.c.
(How can that get called with kill_mode_str == "client"?)  The chain is
then to call tree_close_con
<https://github.com/i3/i3/blob/next/src/tree.c#L369>() -> tree_close
<https://github.com/i3/i3/blob/next/src/tree.c#L192>() -> x_window_kill
<https://github.com/i3/i3/blob/next/src/x.c#L283>() -> one_of {
xcb_destroy_window
<http://www.x.org/archive/current/doc/man/man3/xcb_destroy_window.3.xhtml>(),
xcb_kill_client
<http://www.x.org/archive/current/doc/man/man3/xcb_kill_client.3.xhtml>() }.

I think to answer that I'l have to run i3 with logging so I can see which
path it's taking at the end.  And wait for an appropriately hung process.
My initial hypothesis is that the window supports WM_DELETE_WINDOW but,
since the proc is hung, it never processes it.


Anyway, thanks for any insights.  Clearly this is as much about me learning
as anything else.

No problem with that on ArchLinux.
However, wicd-curses crashes when the connection is up, but by that time
I no longer need it so that won't bother me ;-)

I use netctltray. A simple netctl profile switcher with a tray icon.
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/netctltray/

Works great and no bloat.

I tried with others and with the same effect. So the culprit lies in
OBS, I guess. Sorry for the false alarm.

Subject: [i3] Problems getting Ubuntu repository working
Message-ID: <CACSEOCdDgUqc2fRbWKfKH5nhRwr_F+MjziA8uO59hihSt1CQsg@mail.gmail.com>

Realized my version of i3 is 4.7.2 and that the sur5r repository wasn't
working for me. I'm using xubuntu 14.04 LTS

Here's what I see with apt-get update:

Ign http://debian.sur5r.net -c InRelease

E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones
used instead.

And in my /etc/apt/sources.list file I have:

deb http://debian.sur5r.net/i3/  -c -s) universe

I also tried directly copying "deb http://debian.sur5r.net/i3/ $(lsb_release
-c -s) universe" right into sources.list and am still getting 404's in my
sudo apt-get update.

Any info or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!

http://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html lists:

/etc/apt/sources.list

That command has to be executed. The $(lsb_release -c -s) part will be
replaced by your Ubuntu version when you do that. It seems like you have
not properly executed the command, based on the -c and -s flags showing up
in your sources.list.

solved the problem.

Subject: [i3] i3 new user experiences summary
Message-ID: <20151013230840.GA17629@ofb.net>

Hello All!

I just switched from Notion to i3 about a month ago. In general it's
been a positive experience, I especially appreciate the smaller
configuration file, the more sensible default bindings, the ability to
put windows in a tree (if that's the correct word).

After settling in, I made a quick list of some issues I ran into and
wanted to report back to the developers.

- As a user of the Dvorak keyboard layout, I was confused by the
  result of running i3-config-wizard. I can see how h,t,n,s could be
  used for navigation, but many of the remaining key bindings don't
  make sense - why should 'd' split horizontally, or 'p' restart? This
  wasn't really explained to me through the process of installing and
  trying out the software. I ended up having to revert most of the
  bindings to the Qwerty defaults. I think the wizard made things more
  difficult in the end.

- Coming from Notion, I would have expected the default window layout
  to be tabbed. At first I thought that i3 didn't support a tabbed
  layout, because when I first started it (with killall notion; i3), I
  ended up with 10 unusably-narrow windows. I still don't know how to
  make tabbing the default - when I open windows on a new workspace,
  they always come up split. If I kill and restart i3, then everything
  comes up split (and uselessly narrow).

- I had to ask the IRC channel for the name of the key binding to turn
  a dialog box into a window - perhaps the documentation should be
  improved so new users can avoid this hurdle (e.g. under TERMINOLOGY
  in the man page, there could be an entry explaining that a "Floating
  Window" is something like a dialog box).

- Even after learning the "floating toggle" binding it sometimes
  becomes annoying or confusing to have to press it each time - for
  instance if I have to print a lot of stuff in Firefox, but I
  sometimes want to navigate to other windows when the print dialog is
  open. I also sometimes accidentally turn Firefox into a floating
  window when I'm doing this, and then I wonder where all the other
  windows went.... I would appreciate an option to have dialogs always
  come up as windows by default.

- "focus right" is not always the reverse of "focus left". For
  instance, if the rightmost tab is split horizontally, then one
  command will cycle through all the windows, but the other will get
  stuck cycling through the children of the tab which has been split.
  Same with "focus up" and "focus down" in the stacking layout, when a
  child is split vertically. It seems it would be cleaner to have
  these pairs be strict opposites.

- I like that "i3-nagbar" is available to display error messages, but
  I don't know how to close it with my keyboard... seems like I have
  to use my mouse to close it. I'd prefer to avoid the mouse...!


Well, I hope this isn't too much stuff at once. I'm happy with i3 so
even if you don't fix any of these problems, I'll still use it. As I
mentioned above, I just wanted to report back since it's not always
easy to anticipate how new users will experience a piece of software.

Thanks for all your hard work in developing i3!

Best wishes,

Frederik

The key _positions_ make some sense, the key mnemonics likely don’t. I
don’t think this is a big problem, as users are very likely to change their
config file anyway. Also, you’re free to use/not use the wizard as you see
fit — for most users, using the wizard seems to be the best solution, which
is why it’s started by default.

Does “workspace_layout tabbed” do what you want?

If the print dialog is clearly meant to be floating, Firefox should set the
appropriate window hints. Since you describe you have to manually make it
floating, apparently Firefox doesn’t. You should file a Firefox bug, but
you can work around this with a for_window rule, see
http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_arbitrary_commands_for_specific_windows_for_window

There are several places where the directional commands don’t strictly
operate on the tree and hence focus left/right are not always direct
opposites. We believe that bottomline, this makes it easier for users. Even
if it didn’t make it easier for users, changing it now would be very
disruptive to existing users, so I don’t think we can do much about it.

If you feel strongly, you might be able to implement your own logic using
the IPC interface: http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html

It’s designed to nag you, so this is working as intended :).

Nice to have such clear remarks from a new  (power)user.

I just wanted to add some clarifications/coments.

It is always difficult to mix the key positions and values and to pipck 
reasonable defaults.
On azerty, I want to use hjkl for navigation, but then h is no more 
available for "horizontal split".

Also, it is easier to have the same bindings on all installations, even 
if misplaced.
This way, the tutorials can assume that the users all have Mod+p for 
restart.
If you are experienced enough to change the default bindings, then you 
are experienced enough to transpose the tutorials :-)

As usual, ideas on improving the bindings are welcome.

Also, killing then starting i3 is not a common operation.
You might prefer reload and/or restart as they preserve the layout.

i3 tries to be smart about which windows to keep floating.
Basically, every window that specifically asks to be floating is kept 
floating.

If you want a drastic solution, add

for_window [title=".*"] floating disable

My config tends to add floating windows :

for_window [title="Oz Browser"]       floating enable
for_window [title="Super Hexagon"]    floating enable
for_window [title="^SpaceChem$"]      floating enable
for_window [class="Gnuplot"]          floating enable
for_window [class="FLTK"]             floating enable
#for_window [class="Graphviz"]         floating enable
for_window [window_role="CallWindow"] floating enable

This works much like commant completion in zsh for example.
The right arrow cycles only on the last line of completions.

Subject: [i3] Error: status_command process exited unexpectedly (exit 1)
Message-ID: <CADuF0imbJmtgTLJQ0oyoFwoFEJuhsTLZy9wxYYOOdrK77nDyUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

    when I start i3status with i3 in bar {}, I get the error message: Error:
    status_command process exited unexpectedly (exit 1). Can anyone help?

    I followed the debugging instruction on
http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html.
    When the bar is displayed with

    $ for c in $(i3-msg -t get_bar_config | python -c \ 'import
    json,sys;print("\n".join(json.load(sys.stdin)))'); do \ (i3bar
--bar_id=$c
    >i3bar.$c.log 2>&1) & \ done;

    The bar displays without error. I use Fish shell, Arch Linux and KDE.
Below
    is the log I obtained with "verbose yes", but the log probably contains
no
    error messages because I don't have the error when I restart i3bar this
way.

Could you open an issue for this at https://github.com/i3/i3 please? We’d
like to keep all bugs in one place.

Also, please try changing your login shell from fish to bash before
reporting, just so that you know whether fish is to blame here. We’ve
certainly had trouble with fish before.

It asks for the modifier key and creates the config file. Both of that
could be achieved by using “sed 's/$mod Mod1/$mod Mod4/g' /etc/i3/config >
~/.i3/config”, yes.

The main point why the wizard starts by default is that the default config
file has to use Mod1 (Alt by default) because there are computers which
don’t have a physical Mod4 (Windows by default) key. We strongly want to
encourage people to use Mod4 as a modifier, because that avoids clashes
with key combinations that other software uses. At the same time, we cannot
make the default config use Mod4, because then i3 would just not work on
computers which lack the Windows key.

13 lines out of 69 lines in the i3 default config are bindings that use
keys whose positions typically change depending on the layout — that’s not
even 20% :).

Regardless of the numbers, I think it boils down to personal preference: i3
currently goes the route where the positions make some sense (navigation
keys first and foremost, but also how the remaining keys are positioned).
Some people might prefer the mnemonics to make sense. It’s impossible to
please both crowds.

The default config file is intentionally kept rather short so as to not
overwhelm users. I’m aware of software which goes the opposite route, e.g.
the dovecot config file, which is a reference in which you can remove the
comment sign in front of lots of examples. Again, this is just a matter of
preference.

While the use-case you have is certainly valid, consider that there are
hundreds of equally valid use-cases. I don’t think listing them all in the
default config file is a good idea.

I didn’t try it at the time, both because I’m usually very pressed on time,
and also because I’m not good at understanding what people mean when they
talk about window hierarchies. I tend to ask for specific commands to
reproduce layouts.

I take it you used <open window>, “layout tabbed”, <open window>, “splith”,
<open window>.

Note that in such a situation, you can use “focus parent” to get out of
being stuck.

To clarify, I didn’t mean to say “this specific behavior is easy for
users”. What I was trying to convey is that the logic which the directional
focus commands use is made such that many use-cases are intuitive (notably
these which plenty of users reported as confusing). The price for that is
that in some other situations, the logic is not ideal.

Empirically, we have enough users that almost every change which is not an
addition of new behavior will affect existing users. Most of these changes
affect edge cases, but changes to the focus command have a much bigger
chance of being disruptive, just because every single i3 user uses the
focus command. In addition, the focus command is not something about which
you think before using it; it quickly goes into your muscle memory. I think
it deserves special attention.

i3’s take on backwards compatibility is rather strong. We try really hard
to not break configuration files or existing workflows.

In general, my software should be the opposite of annoying. In the case of
i3-nagbar specifically, though, yes, it absolutely should be annoying. The
reason depends on the occasion on which you get to see i3-nagbar:

1. You have an error in your configfile: i3-nagbar nags you so that you
don’t nag us. Historically, before we had i3-nagbar, a very frequent
bugreport we’d get was caused by users who had a configuration file error
and did not know about the logfile which i3 writes. Introducing i3-nagbar
reduced these sorts of reports significantly.

In case you were just editing your configfile and made a mistake, note that
you don’t have to reach to your mouse: just fix your configfile, reload i3,
i3-nagbar will be gone.

2. Your config file is really old (i3 v3) and we’ve tried to migrate it to
a v4 config file but couldn’t ensure that every directive you’ve had before
could be successfully converted. This is a more debatable case. Our opinion
is that you should be alerted prominently until your config file is in a
working state again. Since you’ll see this message when you start up i3
(not during your work), we think it’s better to spend a minute fixing the
config file instead of realizing a feature doesn’t work while you are
getting your actual work done.

3. You use the default config file and pressed the keybinding to exit i3.
People were occasionally hitting the keybinding by accident and were really
disappointed by losing their entire session. Having i3-nagbar in here with
its annoying confirmation fixes the problem — you have to be really unlucky
or very sure to exit i3. If you dislike this behavior, please change your
configfile to not use i3-nagbar.

Subject: [i3] Debugging techniques.
Message-ID: <562F83C6.2050204@gmail.com>

Hello world!

I am trying to enable debugging in i3, and I am confused by the number 
of different options to do this.

    command line          config option
-- --------------------  -----------------------------
1 i3 --shmlog-size=X shmlog on|off|toggle|<size>
2  i3 -V ?
3  i3 -d all             ?
4  ? debuglog on|off|toggle

So my question are:

Which one is the recommended way ?
Does `shmlog on` imply  `debuglog on` ?
Does `-d all` imply `-V` ?
What size do you recommend for the shmlog size ?
May I assume that the config options cannot be used to debug issues 
prior to loading the configuration file (nor issues while loading the 
configuration file) ?
Which of these options provide enough information for a bug report ? Is 
-V enough ?

It seems that shm logging is better in the sense that it does not 
increase a log file size, but not as nice as it locks some memory space.
What is the reason behind shm logging, instead of the usual logging to 
file + logrotate ?

Best regards,
Layus.

Note that “shmlog on|off|toggle|<size>” refers to a command, not a config
directive.

2  i3 -V ?

Errors (ELOG in the code) are always printed to stdout.
Verbose log messages (LOG in the code) are printed to stdout if -V is
enabled. Intended for curious users.
Debug log messages (DLOG in the code) are printed if -d is enabled.

3 and 4 are the same setting. The “all” argument to -d is obsolete, but
kept for backwards compatibility.

See also https://github.com/i3/i3/issues/1823 for a related discussion.

The recommended way is to use an automatically built version from
http://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html (or i3-git if your package manager
knows how to build automatically build software from git) because otherwise
any of your findings will need to be confirmed again on a more recent
version.

These versions automatically enable debug logging to shared memory (they
check whether they were built from a git version that is not a release
version).

No.

No.

25MB (arbitrarily chosen, but proven to be enough for all issues we’ve

If you specify them as command-line parameters to i3, they will be active
before loading the configuration file.

Please use -V -d all, as per section 2 of
http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html

Correct.

It’s easier for us to set aside a chunk of memory than to make sure that
every user of i3 knows about having to logrotate a file away. Anecdotally,
we’ve had a bunch of users whose hard drive (or RAM, in case of /tmp being
on tmpfs) filled up because of an ever-growing i3 logfile.

Subject: [i3] Weird keybinding issue after suspend
Message-ID: <CAKV6X6wU04fFqnn=mQ_7V1PZJ9j0Lj60W0XT=pSKoQV_ym8DNA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've got a really weird issue that's been bothering me for perhaps the last
6 months (before then it worked fine, perhaps could have been around when I
switched to using my keyboard to suspend). Sometimes when I resume from
suspend (I have i3lock launching at the same time as when I suspend) I can
unlock my computer, but then no more keyboard events work. The keyboard
remains active (lights on) and I can switch to a TTY, but none of the i3
events fire. The only way I can fix it is to use the mouse (which is still
working) to click on a workspace in the statusbar and then the keyboard
responds again.

 As mentioned above, it only happens sometimes, and as a fellow dev it
really annoys me to no end when something is unreproducible. Things I have
tried to reproduce are just suspending, then detaching my keyboard and
attaching it again before resuming from suspend, but that doesn't trigger
the issue. Just about the only common thing I can find is time (after being
suspended for a long time, 12hours+, it seems to happen more frequently).

One idea I've had is that because I use a keyboard shortcut to suspend
(`bindsym --release $mod+Control+Shift+s exec "systemctl suspend; i3lock"`
in my config, the --release was me weeks ago trying to rectify the issue,
but it still persisted) i3wm is somehow holding onto the keyboard before
flushing, but then post-suspend, i3lock takes the keyboards focus, i3wm
holds onto an old un-flushed pointer to the keyboard (not sure if that is
how that works) and doesn't refresh it upon i3lock giving up focus.
>From searching around in the i3 source code, seeing the line in
main.c:main() with the comment annotation
    /* Grab the keyboard to get all input */
    xcb_flush(conn);
And that function also occuring in click.c:route_click() (i.e. when I click
the workspaces in the status bar)
    xcb_flush(conn);
Maybe this is what is allowing the keyboard to work again. Is there some
way this could be run upon i3lock giving up focus / i3wm resuming focus?

Any help in solving this would be much appreciated!

Here is some information about my system:
Mouse: Razer Naga, (one with 12 buttons on side)
Keyboard: ducky shine 3 with mini usb cable for connection (issue has
occurred on my laptops internal keyboard also though)
Distro: Arch Linux
i3 Version: 4.11
Kernel version: 4.2.3-1-ARCH

Cheers,
Ben Kaiser

Thank you for the detailed answer.

I think I have sorted it all out.

My use case is an i3 session started with some session manager like gdm 
or kdm (or any other *dm).
In that setup, the users have little access to the arguments passed to i3.

Let's assume the system uses an i3 build from git at master.
It should be sufficient to start i3 as "i3 --shmlog-size=25000000 -V -d 
all" to get extended logs including the starting phase, and suitable for 
bug reports.

If users are annoyed by the memory usage, they can add 'exec 
--no-startup-id i3-msg shmlog no' to their config.

This way, I enable users to
1) access complete logs suitable for debug without needing root access
2) disable i3 logging if they do not want it

If it is not an up-to-date git build, they can still use the logs it for 
their own debug purposes.

Do you think the idea of always starting i3 with the 
"--shmlog-size=25000000 -V -d all" parameters makes sense ?
