&gt;<i> Hi DR,

</I>&gt;<i> Quoting DR (2012-06-22 15:14:23)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently i3 sends event with quite bad timing. For example, the
</I>&gt;<i> workspaces
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; event 'focus' is sent before the tree_render() is called (in other
</I>&gt;<i> words, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; focus has not been actually changed, only the internal states of i3wm is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changed). Although the differences is just fractions of a second, it may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confuse some applications which rely heavily on the correct timing (for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example, i3bar with my upcoming patches).
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t understand why you need this distinction. For which feature
</I>&gt;<i> precisely is it important that the X11 representation is most likely (!)
</I>&gt;<i> changed? Could you elaborate a bit please?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I've told you that problem before. The auto-hiding i3bar causes the
workspace immediately switch back after switch to another workspace.

The solution you suggests is to hide i3bar after receive the reply of
'workspace' command. I deceided not to use that solution after some
thoughts: 1)what if the 'workspace' command isn't issued by i3bar? 2)My
attempt to make a event-based i3bar would be meaningless if I use this
solution.

So this patch is the solution I come up with.

(I don't know, but could the X11 representation be unchanged after a
tree_render()?)

Best regards,
&gt;<i> Michael
