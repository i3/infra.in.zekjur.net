<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for addressing those concerns.

</I>
That does make sense to me. Is there any reason why we might not want
to queue the events? If so, the IPC API could be simplified a bit. I'd
prefer if ipc_queue/unqueue_event() were renamed to ipc_start_queuing
and ipc_stop_queuing_and_drain. ipc_send_event_unqueue doesn't fully
describe what the function does either.

That said, in situations like this, when you have to make a design
decision, I'd recommend talking to Michael before actually working on
the code.

Other than those pending design decisions, the patch looks good. A few nitpicks:

* Please make ipc_is_queued static.

* Please use foo(void) instead of foo(). foo(void) is the prototype of
an ANSI C function that takes no arguments, whereas foo() is the
declaration of a K&amp;R function.

* Keep the functions separated by an empty line in ipc.c (check how
other functions are separated in that file).

* In ipc.h, add the documentation on top of the function prototypes,
using &quot;/**&quot; in the first line of the comment (take a look at other
functions).

* You might want to document ipc_send_event_unqueue better. Also,
please punctuate the documentation of a function.

Regards,
</PRE>
