<PRE>Hi Mateusz,

Quoting Mateusz Loskot (2012-06-19 21:01:49)
&gt;<i> In the video, Michael mentioned simplicity of bugs reporting is crucial.
</I>&gt;<i> Lately, at least 2-3 people asked on IRC how to report a bug to i3wm.
</I>I think this is pretty interesting. We have a big button stating &quot;bugs&quot;
on our website. After clicking there, there is a button saying &quot;new
ticket&quot;. I think that&#8217;s pretty obvious, especially for our target
audience of advanced users and developers. What I was talking about in
the tech talk was that there should be no obstacles like forced
registration.

Anyway, that being said, I welcome anything which makes it more
straight-forward to report a bug. That may be as simple as a better
input form for trac (stackoverflow-style?). Maybe there already are such
projects. Ideas and feedback welcome.

Best regards,
Michael
