<PRE>Hi Fernando,

Quoting Fernando Lemos (2012-06-29 03:37:13)
&gt;<i> When i3 is restarted, so is i3bar. Looks like when i3bar quits, its
</I>&gt;<i> window is destroyed and the embedded windows receive a BadWindow error
</I>&gt;<i> [1]. Seems to be a design issue in XEmbed itself:
</I>They shouldn&#8217;t, though. Have a look at the code. When i3bar receives an
EOF (or does it not receive an EOF in that case? maybe we should make it
restart-aware) it first properly kills all embedded tray icons.

&gt;<i> What happens here, I guess, is that some clients may try to create the
</I>&gt;<i> tray icon again, while others may not. Or maybe they do, but i3bar
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't up by the time they retry (I'm guessing here, I really didn't
</I>&gt;<i> read XEmbed).
</I>In case they don&#8217;t retry, they are violating the spec. Also, the
embedder can be down for an arbitrary amount of time. The tray
application is supposed to deal with that. And at least nm-applet does
(so do all GTK-based ones probably). Note however that when the embedder
does not properly kill the tray clients, they may not retry at all. So
this is probably what&#8217;s happening here (as you described above).

&gt;<i> XEmbed also says that &quot;the protocol ends&quot; when the embedded window is
</I>&gt;<i> reparented to the root window [2]. So I don't know much about X, but
</I>&gt;<i> maybe reparenting the embedded windows to the root window before
</I>&gt;<i> terminating would be a solution? I'm not sure how the clients are
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to react, though.
</I>As I said, we should be doing that :).

&gt;<i> What puzzles me is that you guys say it also happens when returning
</I>&gt;<i> from suspend... I have no idea why that is, I always thought suspend
</I>&gt;<i> was (mostly) transparent to applications?
</I>Yes, it definitely should be transparent to applications. My guess is
that for some reason, a monitor reconfiguration event is sent and i3
restarts i3bar because of that. However, that&#8217;s a different code path
than the i3 restart, so it&#8217;s quite a mystery to me currently.

Best regards,
Michael
