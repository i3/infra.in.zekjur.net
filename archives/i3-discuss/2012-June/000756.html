When i3 is restarted, so is i3bar. Looks like when i3bar quits, its
window is destroyed and the embedded windows receive a BadWindow error
[1]. Seems to be a design issue in XEmbed itself:

&quot;The protocol, as currently constituted, is not robust against the
embedder crashing. This will result in the embedder window being
destroyed by the X server, and, as a consequence client's window being
unexpectedly destroyed, which will likely cause the client to die with
a BadWindow error.&quot;

What happens here, I guess, is that some clients may try to create the
tray icon again, while others may not. Or maybe they do, but i3bar
wasn't up by the time they retry (I'm guessing here, I really didn't
read XEmbed).

XEmbed also says that &quot;the protocol ends&quot; when the embedded window is
reparented to the root window [2]. So I don't know much about X, but
maybe reparenting the embedded windows to the root window before
terminating would be a solution? I'm not sure how the clients are
supposed to react, though.

What puzzles me is that you guys say it also happens when returning
from suspend... I have no idea why that is, I always thought suspend
was (mostly) transparent to applications?
