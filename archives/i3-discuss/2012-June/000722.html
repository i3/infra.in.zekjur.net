Yes, for myself the path to a bug report or where to send patches
is clear and straightforward indeed. Perhaps it would help some folks
if it is marked with bigger signs. It's just an observation.

&gt;<i> What I was talking about in
</I>&gt;<i> the tech talk was that there should be no obstacles like forced
</I>&gt;<i> registration.
</I>
Yes, and i3's approach is really good.

&gt;<i> Anyway, that being said, I welcome anything which makes it more
</I>&gt;<i> straight-forward to report a bug. That may be as simple as a better
</I>&gt;<i> input form for trac (stackoverflow-style?). Maybe there already are such
</I>&gt;<i> projects. Ideas and feedback welcome.
</I>
Is there a need for anything simpler really?
I think Trac is minimalistic here.

Perhaps &quot;How to report a bug or send a patch?&quot; clearly answered
in the faq.i3wm.org and linked from /contact page would do the job
for those who need it.
