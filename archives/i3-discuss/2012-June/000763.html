<PRE>Hi,

Quoting Michael Stapelberg (2012-06-29 11:53:46)
&gt;<i> I&#8217;ll read your e-mail explanation and will try to reproduce your
</I>&gt;<i> original problem, then come up with a better reply. Give me a few hours
</I>&gt;<i> ;-).
</I>Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t found the original description of the problem
you were referring to. I&#8217;ve searched the bugtracker and my emails, but I
guess we only talked about it on IRC?

Anyway, I assume the problem is that i3bar sends the workspace command
to i3 and then unhides, which generates an EnterNotify event for a
window on the current workspace. i3 then gets scheduled, sees the
workspace command, switches to the target workspace and then processes
the EnterNotify event, which leads to switching back to the old
workspace.

To avoid this situation, I would recommend the following:
After sending the workspace command, i3bar needs to perform a
sync_with_i3 sequence, as used in the testcases (see [1]) and
documented at [2]. Afterwards, i3bar can be sure that X11 has been
updated and it can safely unmap itself.

As for the situation where other clients send a workspace event and
i3bar unmaps in such a timeframe that the same race condition is
triggered, the other client has to perform a sync_with_i3, too. In
addition, it has to call xcb_grab_server() before sending the workspace
event and xcb_ungrab_server() after the sync_with_i3. This will
guarantee that no Unmap-requests by i3bar will be processed by X11 in
the meantime.

Best regards,
Michael
