<PRE>Michael,

Sorry for the reply on this.

It finally took a strong cold that knocked me out of the office for almost
a week, so I could spend some time to dig into the i3 a little better.

I take back what I said, because the documentation is amazingly detailed
and easy to understand. Practically everything I needed was there, I (and
most) just don't have the time to go through it all at first hand, I guess.
Apologies on that.

I congratulate you guys because, considering what'S out there in terms of
open source projects, this is IMO a very well written documentation.

If I can, just to push my boundaries, say anything, I have one opinion, but
not directly with the documentation website itself, but with the
configuration file:

- Could we place all settings and (brief documentation as comments) inside
the configuration template, like other big projects similarly do? (Apache,
PHP, MySQL, etc). The fact it is all there, with default values, showing
how it is behaving as of that moment kind of explains it better than an
extensive document online.

Looking at some configs people shared here within this thread (thanks for
that), I reckon most of them end up doing something similar to that, even
placing their own comments to remind them about what that particular
section is about... Maybe having this by default could help exposing all
theses features at once.

Regards,
