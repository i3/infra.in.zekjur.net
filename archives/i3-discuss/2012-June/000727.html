You are blazingly fast when something pops up on the irc channel. If
it were possible, it would probably be better to increase the lag on
irc, for the sake of being a bit faster on the bug reports. I don't
know for real, but the people who report something have put a bit
more effort in it. 

But, there is this saying in my language: The best sailors are
standing ashore :) 

I could join a bug triaging party on irc on some lazy sunday, but be
aware that my participation will possibly cost more time than it will
gain :) 

Cheers,
