<PRE>(Eventually I've got some time to rework patches I sent previously. I
divide them into mutually unrelated parts, and will send them in different
threads, according to Fernando's suggestion. So this is the first one).

Currently i3 sends event with quite bad timing. For example, the workspaces
event 'focus' is sent before the tree_render() is called (in other words,
the focus has not been actually changed, only the internal states of i3wm
is changed). Although the differences is just fractions of a second, it may
confuse some applications which rely heavily on the correct timing (for
example, i3bar with my upcoming patches).

So I add facilities to queue outward events up until the tree_render is
done.
