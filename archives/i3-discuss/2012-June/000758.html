&gt;<i>From what I can tell, i3 just calls xcb_flush, which means all
</I>commands were sent to the server [1] (though I think in theory ). Now
what you wanted is probably something akin to XSync, which means the
server has received *and* processed the commands [2].

There's no xcb_sync, but I think anything you &quot;get&quot; from the server
would &quot;sync&quot; the connection like XSync, if I understand how X works
(and that's probably where Michael drew inspiration for sync_with_i3
in the testcases). So yes, the server representation could be
unchanged after a tree_render. It all depends if you get anything back
from X in tree_render *after* you xcb_flushed the commands that you
wanted to flush in order to change the server representation the way
you intended. So maybe you're just narrowing the window for a race
condition.
