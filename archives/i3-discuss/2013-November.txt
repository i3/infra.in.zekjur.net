please, find two log files attached (.dump.log is result of i3-dump-log
and .log is configured during i3 start)

> uname -a
FreeBSD 9.2 amd64

> i3 --version
i3 version 4.6 (2013-08-07, branch "tags/4.6") ?? 2009-2013 Michael Stapelberg and contributors

> pkg info|grep "firef\|emacs"
emacs-24.3
firefox-23.0.1


what was done:

1. start i3 (it starts emacs and firefox automatically)
2. switch to emacs desktop (No.4) and started jabber.el mode
3. switched to desktop No.1 and launched terminal
4. sent myself test message from another box

   desktop No.4 indicator remained as was

5. switched to firefox desktop (No.10) and started to download file
6. switched to desktop No.1 and waited until ff spawns info popup
   concerning the download completion

   desktop No.10 indicator remained as was (may be because of ff pop, but
   in older versions of i3 I remember it was showing the event)

7. prepared log files

i3 is not seeing any urgency hint changes, which you can verify by using
bzgrep -i urgen i3log-20131104_111417.dump.log.bz2 ? all the lines show
that either the urgency state changes to 0, or it is ignored because the
window is currently focused.

So, I?d check jabber.el to see whether it properly updates the urgency
hint.

I think the following commit adresses this:
http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/commit/?h=next&id=e99158e419d4204bbce16ea5df249c630636ed3d
(it?s newer than the version of i3 you are running)

Hi everyone,

I am very happy with i3 so far, and I am deeply grateful to the
developers for such a useful, clean, and well-documented piece of
software. I have however an obsession with maximizing  screen real
state, and I wonder if it is possible in i3 to do a couple of things.

First of all, I wonder if I can suppress the generic borders around
windows and have instead separators of fixed width between them (with
separators appearing only when it is necessary to delimit windows),
more or less like tmux does to separate panes (or like ion3/notion to
separate frames, for that matter). In such a situation, the separators
would not change color according to the state of the windows (only the
color of the window titles would indicate the state). My goal is to
show borders only when they are needed, and when that's the case, use
a 1px line.

Second, can I set the border between containers in a different color
than the background color? If I am not mistaken, the background color
sets both the background of the window title as well as the color
around the window, and I'd like to set them separately.

In case I didn't explain myself well, here is an image summarizing
what I'd like to achieve: http://postimg.org/image/csjo2oqjh/

Thanks a lot for your attention,

Dani

The relevant options we have in i3 for tuning the behavior in the areas
you are talking about are:

http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_border_style_for_new_windows
(border 1pixel)

http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_hiding_vertical_borders
(hide_edge_borders both)

Apart from that, see
http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_changing_colors for the colors and
experiment some.

More customization options than that for border style and colors are
extremely unlikely to be accepted into i3. We already have a high number
of options, and I don?t see this as an area that is so important that it
would justify introducing more complexity. See also
https://faq.i3wm.org/question/778/why-is-patch-not-merged-and-made-optional/

Hope that helps.

Hi Michael,

thanks for your quick answer and comments. I had read the
documentation and experienced with the colors, and I didn't get what I
was looking for. In any case, I perfectly understand your policy of
not incorporating more options unless it is a necessary feature.

All the best

Hi Thiago,

you need the devel package of libxkbcommon: something like 
libxkbcommon-dev (the exact name depends on the distro you are using.

If I'm not wrong I ran (I'm not at my main dev machine to verify):

sudo apt-get install libxkbcommon-dev

I'm at Ubuntu 12.04.

Maybe it's installed at some weird location :
You should try something like "locate xkbcommon.h", check that it's installed at some location, and add "-I/path/to/the/directory" to the CFLAGS of i3.
Be sure to add the path to the directory containing the "xkbcommon" directory.

My strong guess is that your version of libxkbcommon-dev is too old. You
need ? 0.2.0, anything earlier than that will not work.

i3 has nothing to do with keyboards (apart from grabbing the keybindings
you configure in i3).

If the layout is different from what you expect, use setxkbmap to change
it, e.g. ?setxkbmap br?.

What do the following commands return?

pkg-config --list-all | grep xkbcommon
pkg-config --cflags --libs xkbcommon

Also, did you pass --prefix=/usr? My guess is that the version installed
by your package manager takes precedence over the one that you installed
locally.

Given that you are a Chromium contributor apparently, I would?ve
expected you to be familiar with C, libraries and their typical
installation procedure :). This stuff is really not i3 specific.

Hi,

Anyone knows, or have any clue, why I might be getting this:

$ ./i3lock
./i3lock: symbol lookup error: ./i3lock: undefined symbol: xkb_context_new

$ pkg-config --cflags xkbcommon
-I/usr/local/include

$ pkg-config --libs xkbcommon
-L/usr/local/lib -lxkbcommon

In my libxkbcommon checkout I ran:
$ sudo make install

Do I need to install it elsewhere or do something else?

Regards,

Passed to much time without having to worry about this. We don't have
such worries there, everything is setup for us.
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/+/trunk/build/install-build-deps.sh
We have gclient, tons of utilities in depot_tools, gyp, and so on.
That we don't have to fight the system and deal with such in the
day-by-day.

Got it!

In libxkbcommon:
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install

Then in i3lock:
$ make
$ ./i3lock
