I think so, if you can do it in a sane patch. Also note that min_width
supports not only integers, but also text.

Thanks to the macro capabilities, this should be another small patch.

Oh, I did not know that. What string values are to be supported? Is safe 
to parse them as integers? Thanks.

Hi all,

I'd like to introduce you the first release of a new i3bar status line:
i3blocks.

The main idea behind this project is to respect the i3bar protocol [1] as
well as providing the simplest interface for the user. This means that each
block is the ouput of a shell command line.
It supports click events, signals and different time intervals, through a
simple config file.

I hope that everything is detailed on the project page:

https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks

Please let me know if you have any comment or question!

Cheers,
Vivien

Nice project!

@Michael: as you tout i3status as being sensitive regarding resource 
usage, what about adding a caching mechanism to i3status to support 
distinct update time intervals for the different blocks as well?

This is great.

It will be better if i3 could automatically start all the programs for
me. I think it's possible for programs that support startup
notification.

Could this feature be added, or is it too much to integrate into i3?

I got it wrong here. Startup notification is not needed, we could use
_NET_WM_PID.

It?s a bit rude to hijack this thread, so let?s keep it brief: instead
of caching, I?d rather see event-based updates, but that requires a huge
refactoring with very very little gain, so I?m not going to do it (and
probably not going to accept patches for it either). I think SardemFF7?s
j4status has an architecture that is event-based, but I have never used
it.

Subject: [i3] trying to build default layout at start
Message-ID: <ffb674a90a7a8df1db6f82ccc2f53368@neutralite.org>

Hello.

Since I always have the same layout ( basically, a horizontal layout 
with 1 vertical layout containing --at start-- 1 terminal on a side, and 
on the other one, 2 other terminals in a vertical layout: debugging and 
editing of unit testing for 2nd vertical layout, source code edition on 
first one ) on workspace 1, and start it every-time, I tried to do bind 
that script:

#!/bin/sh
x-terminal-emulator &
x-terminal-emulator &
i3-msg 'split v' &
x-terminal-emulator &

to a key, but it does not work. Started from a terminal, all windows 
appear, but only in a vertical layout, and the script writes 
"[{"success":true}]". Since it is a problem of speed, I can do a small 
workaround.

But, binded to a key, nothing appears.

So I tried another approach, which is to do that work only at i3's 
start-up. Here are the lines I added:

exect x-terminal-emulator
exect x-terminal-emulator
exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'split v'
exect x-terminal-emulator

Again, no terminal is spawned. Right after those lines, I had a section 
like this:

assign [class="XOsview" ] 10
exec xosview

assign [class="Claws-mail" ] 10
exec claws-mail

exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace 10'
exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace 1'

Which basically starts both xosview and claws on the 10th workspace, 
plus move each screen's starting workspace to 1 ( primary screen ) and 
10 ( second one ).
It worked fine, even with the added lines.
Now, I thought that the assignations are not useful if correct 
workspaces are selected before starting things. So I replaced those 
lines with:

exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace 10'
exec xosview
exec claws-mail
exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace 1'

which I thought would be ok, but the results are really strange:
xosview is started on workspace 1, claws on workspace 7 ( see note 
below ), and shown workspaces are correct with 1 and 10. If it would 
only be speed, I suppose that both applications would be on workspace 1, 
or one on workspace 10, or both on workspace 10 ( which is the desired 
behavior, finally ), but one is spawn on workspace 7.
I suppose that when i3 receives the command to switch to workspace 10 
which is on the secondary screen, it starts by switching to second 
screen, with the lowest possible workspace selected ( 7 in my case ), 
then switch to desired workspace.
Am I wrong? If I am, how could I work around that problem?

Thanks in advance for any advice, opinion, or pointer you could give me 
to fix and/or understand that problem.


NOTES:
Note 1:
Each screen have some affected workspaces 1-4 are for primary screen, 
5-6 are not affected, 7-10 are affected to secondary screen:

workspace 1 output $prim_screen
workspace 2 output $prim_screen
workspace 3 output $prim_screen
workspace 4 output $prim_screen

workspace 7 output $sec_screen
workspace 8 output $sec_screen
workspace 9 output $sec_screen
workspace 10 output $sec_screen

Note 2:
Using Debian (amd64) stable on some computers with some testing 
packages including i3. Unstable on another one.
x-terminal-emulator is used in my commands, and default terminal 
emulator on my computer is lxterminal.

PS:
I already noticed some bugs probably related to slowness of something. 
Often, at startup, I summon some terminals, switch to another workspace, 
try to summon things, and they are summoned on workspace 1, even if I 
started them when other workspace was shown.
Boring, but not critical, and I never had the will to fix it. Now, this 
layout problem is annoying enough for me to make me interesting in 
understanding why it does not work.

Erm... ok, on that part, the problem was a typo... I apologizes.
Lack of reading after writing, and copy/paste are always wrong when 
doing things...

So, fixing this made the terminals appear, but all on workspace 7, in a 
single horizontal layout. This is still wrong, but at least they 
appear...

OK, I am not in a good day when it comes to thinking, I guess.

The folder where my personal scripts relies was not in the $PATH, 
because I had modified it into ~/.profile instead of ~/.bash_profile.
So I have added some sleep instructions after every i3-msg commands, 
and can summon a ( very ) basic layout:

#!/bin/sh
delay=0.03s
i3-msg 'split h'
sleep $delay
x-terminal-emulator &
x-terminal-emulator &
sleep $delay
i3-msg 'split v'
x-terminal-emulator &

So, my errors were simple pebcak. Sorry for the noise.
It still does not explains the behavior of sending things on workspace 
7 in previous configurations, however. And it does not solve the ( only 
) boring problem of i3 being sometimes slower than I.

Hi,

Instead of using sleep commands, why not try the new layout restore
functionality we have in our git version? See

You can run the following command to register the binding. (change
layout as appropriate)
setxkbmap -layout us,gr -option grp:alt_shift_toggle
You can put this line in your ~/.xprofile which most display managers
will source when they start.
If you start with xinit (startx), you can simply put
source ~/.xprofile

before the "exec i3" line

Because I am currently using the deb package, and so was not aware of 
features added after :)

This will be a great feature, thanks a lot ! ( and so, maybe I'll use a 
compiled version )
This wm is really becoming awesome... I mean, the word, not the wm ;)

btw, i3blocks does handle events.
If you set for instance signal=10 to a block, it will be updated when
i3blocks receives a SIGUSR1 (you can take a look at the default "volume"
block, and try "amixer -q set Master 2dB+ unmute && killall -USR1
i3blocks").
Also, if your script does not check the BLOCK_BUTTON env variable, clicking
on the block will result in re-updating it (it's particulary useful for the
network block, when connecting to a SSID or (un)plugging ethernet and want
to have the IP update right away).

Cheers,

i3 only works on Linux. I recommend asking your tutor, as in-person help
is very valuable and works much better than trying to help other people
over the internet.

Once you have Linux running on your machine and are somewhat accustomed
to it, feel free to install i3 and try to get it running.

Note that i3 is _NOT_ recommended for people who are just getting
started with Linux. Our target audience is power users and programmers
specifically.

Subject: [i3] [i3lock] blur effect
Message-ID: <531627B0.2060204@gmail.com>

Hello,

I am a new i3 user and I used a wrapper for i3lock.

https://github.com/ashinkarov/i3-extras/blob/master/i3lock-wrapper

This wrapper script takes a screenshot of the desktop before starting 
i3lock.
Then it blurs it and uses that blurred screenshot as the background for 
i3lock.

I was a little bored and little unsatisfied with the script.
So I wanted to make it better.


As a result of learning and hacking, I can now present to you a i3lock fork.

https://github.com/karulont/i3lock-blur/tree/fuzzy

It uses COMPOSITE extension to get the windows current state.
It uses DAMAGE extension to know when to redraw.
It uses OpenGL to blur the image.

Currently there is a lack of error checking, but I am still working on it.

But interested parties can get the fuzzy branch, build it using make.
And test the new blurred background feature by using cmdline switch '-f' 
(f for fuzzy).

Example: cd directory
                  make
                  ./i3lock -f

Hi Karl,

nice idea, but I don't really understand why you not just draw on
i3lock's window? That way you don't have to maintain a fork, we keep the
number of forks to a minimum (so? 0 hopefully ^^) and still everyone
gets to implement their favourite thingy as a wrapper. You can use
"xwininfo -name i3lock" or something similar to get the window id of
i3lock.

Just a thought.

Best,

Axel

At first I didn't even knew what I was doing.
Now I could write my own program, which paints on the i3lock's window. 
But then there would be  a race condition between i3lock drawing and my 
wrapper drawing. And I wouldn't get a good result.

I understand that forks are kind of unwanted. I created this just out of 
boredom. If the guys here think that this feature might be added 
upstream, I would be very happy about it. But currently this is not yet 
ready to be used by the "masses".

Good point, that was somewhat carelessly expressed. It also works on
NetBSD, and most likely other operating systems. Essentially anywhere
you can run X11 and all the i3 dependencies.

That said, it sure works best on Linux. And it?s particularly hard to
use it on OS X due to Aqua vs. X11.app :).

I?m not sure how this would work. Are you suggesting that all programs
which were opened should be started again?

This is a bit tricky. Theoretically, there is the WM_COMMAND hint in
which programs can store a command line with which they can be started
again.

However, the hint is rarely set, and when it?s set, it?s typically not
accurate.

Therefore, I currently think adding some code to use this will not be
very successful, and letting users add a bunch of ?exec? lines in their
i3 config files (or session restore scripts) is acceptable.

Which OS to chose is a very personal and often heated debate. I?d ask
people to kindly not reply to this to avoid flamewars.

Dharmin, please ask whoever will help you in real life. As I mentioned,
this is not a good thing to talk about online.

I think there're other ways. For example, there's _NET_WM_PID which can be
used to find correspond command line. If the application is started via
i3's exec and supports start notification, _NET_STARTUP_ID can be used.

Maybe. When I get some time, I will do some experiments to see if it will
work or not.

I personally would *REALLY* like to see this kind of drag'n'drop
functionality in i3. I haven't used Eclipse for ages, but dockabe widget in
Qt 4.x are quite good too. For example try do move docked widget around in
Qt Designer, except in Designer it's limited to always leave empty area in
the center.

>From what I remember Visual Studio has the best implementation. Whenever you
start dragging a window, you see this kind of popup
http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC570696.png, so you just drag to the
icon. It's very easy to achieve any kind of layout with just a mouse. You
can do even more, organize tabs, make window floatable and vice versa. I
couldn't find any video on youtube to show how it works, maybe I will record
one.

If the implementation is good, there is nothing to customize. It would just
work.

Subject: [i3] [i3status] Update interval alignment glitch
Message-ID: <531EE8F5.40008@hunsicker.de>

Howdy,

i3status uses the following code to determine how much time it should 
wait until the output is generated again:

/* To provide updates on every full second (as good as possible)
  * we don?t use sleep(interval) but we sleep until the next
  * second (with microsecond precision) plus (interval-1)
  * seconds. We also align to 60 seconds modulo interval such
  * that we start with :00 on every new minute. */
struct timeval current_timeval;
gettimeofday(&current_timeval, NULL);
struct timespec ts = {interval - 1 - current_timeval.tv_sec % interval,
      (10e5 - current_timeval.tv_usec) * 1000};


This works fine if nanosleep() is not interrupted. But when interrupted 
(to force an update by sending the USR1 signal), the alignment most 
often means that the next invocation does not happen after 'interval' 
seconds, but earlier (I'm using a 5 sec interval time)!

Would it not be more important to enforce that updates happen (roughly) 
every 'interval' seconds? Is it really that important to update at the 
start of a new minute anyway?

I would propose that the code is at least changed that the alignment 
only happens once per minute in order to maximize correctness towards 
the interval time instead of the minute alignment.

Does that sound reasonable? Thanks.

Cheers,
   Marco

I don?t understand why you are asking which behavior is more
important. Can?t we fix this problem properly and have both?

Well, sometimes there is behavior for no good reason and if I touch the 
code anyway, I might as well get rid of the alignment.

But if it should stay there, fine with me. I will forward a patch for 
review. Thanks.

Hi Marco,

As I'm the one who added this alignment in the first place [1], I
somewhat feel obligated to answer here :-)
At that time, I did not think about nanosleep() being interupted.

Can you describe under which circumstances i3status receives an USR1?
I've never noticed such a behavior...

What would be your preferred solution here? As for me, we must decide on
what we consider more important (the implementation is easy in either
case): The overall number of refreshs? Have nice numbers?

Possible solutions:
1) We could suppress or defer the signal and continue sleeping until the
proper number of seconds have passed. Not what I'd like to do...
2) We could refresh and start with the intervals from there. This
however means that we drop the alignment. This basically amounts to the
code before I changed it.
3) We could refresh, start with the intervals from there and realign
every minute or so. In this case, we have another shorter interval right
before a new minute starts and "ugly" numbers in between.
4) We could refresh and return to the alignment directly afterwards.
That is what happens right now.

As I don't care about an additional refresh once in a while, I'd go for
the nice numbers... What are your opinions?

Cheers,
Gereon

I haven't checked the timeline, but that feature probably has been added 
later and nobody noticed the consequences.

The signal has been added to be able to force a refresh of the output 
from the outside. The most common example is to refresh the status if 
the system volume has been changed (commonly done right in the i3 config).

It's really a minor issue, but I think the given interval time should 
matter. And yes, the number of refreshes increases if the alignment is 
performed on each update. Personally, I don't see a need for alignment 
at all, but it's no problem to support both, so this seems the way to go.

It can happen quite often. I for one force an update on every window 
focus change.

I'm about to submit a patch that will ensure that the minute alignment 
will be performed only once per minute. This ensures the given interval 
is obeyed as much as possible, but still perform the alignment. The best 
of both worlds :)

The whole point of the signal is to force a refresh immediately, so 
that's not really an option.

That's what my patch does. What do you mean by "ugly numbers"? I get the 
feeling that I totally miss the point ;)

The alignment is there purely for aesthetic reasons, right? That the 
clock displays the seconds in a predictable way?

I don't display seconds in my clock and therefore the alignment makes no 
sense for me at all.

So what about a patch that inspects the time definitions to see if 
seconds are involved and only performs the alignment if that is the 
case? Does that sound like a viable strategy? Thanks.

Message-ID: <CAOLBW9p1=dEaYj3Toq6yP7m377E+crByrZsbu27S24Dwb7s0hA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.
There are very handy back-and-forth switching ability among workspace in i3.

I would like to propose you an idea of "toggle mode" for a key binding.

Suppose I want to switch among two actions by pressing one keybiniding.

For example I want to switch between two border styles (normal and 1pixel)
for window by pressing one key combination.

Proposal syntax for new addition:

           bindsym $mod+t border normal | border 1pixel

What do you think about this?

There already is the ?border toggle? command.

I don?t think there is much value in having a generic toggle command as
you propose. The commands for which toggling makes sense already have
toggling implemented.

In case you need a more advanced toggle logic, you can always use the
IPC interface:

Unless I misunderstand what you?re trying to say, that sounds like a
horrible hack, not a viable strategy :).

I think strategy 3, i.e. refreshing upon SIGUSR1, starting with the
intervals from there and still aligning to minutes, sounds like the best
option.

Well, it's certainly not the cleanest approach, but as the patterns are 
clearly documented and probably won't change over time, it does not 
sound horrible to me. But you decide ;)

But it's only a compromise if I understand the intention of the minute 
aligning correctly.

What about a general option to control the behavior of the loop? 
Essentially one extra line of code compared to option 3.

Cheers,
   Marco

Why is it a compromise? What is the intention behind the minute
aligning? I thought it?s to have an update at the beginning of every
minute, just as we align on full seconds. This will still be true with
the proposed change. And in case people who use minute alignment don?t
want to have updates during the minute, they should just not send
SIGUSR1 to i3status, right?

I'm not sure as no one really explained it. From Gereon's comment 
regarding "ugly numbers" my guess is that the alignment should make sure 
that the refreshes happen in a deterministic way in order to display the 
time information in a consistent manner.

05s -> 10s-> 15s -> 20s. You never see 01s 02s 03s 11s etc.

Therefore his preference to perform the alignment always, not only upon 
a new minute.

My thinking initially, hence my patch. But now I'm not sure anymore.

A bit prohibitive to my liking as the signal is very useful and I would 
rather find a solution that works for all use cases. But then I don't 
know how many users find the alignment essential. I don't include 
seconds with my clock. I could do without any alignment at all, 
therefore my idea to inspect the time information.

Personally, I'm fine with the patch. But in order to cater for all 
needs, I would find a new configuration option worth thinking about. 
This would enable all parties to choose the policy which makes most 
sense to them. The new default could be to align only once, but users 
would be able to disable alignment or enforce it always.

Cheers,
   Marco

No matter what you align on (e.g. 05, 10, 15, as you described), the
signal will always _force_ an update right now. If you don?t want that,
don?t send the signal. The next update after the signal should happen at
the regular interval, i.e. as if the signal was not sent.

I don?t think adding a configuration option for this subtlety is worth
it.

I was probably too fixated on my needs. You're right with your 
conclusion that someone who prefers the alignment might just want to 
wait a little while for the next automatic refresh.

But there is still the (small) problem of misalignment after startup.

If you're fine with the provided patch, I certainly am. It's a pity that 
Gereon did not comment any further.

Sorry, I?m not of much help here. I copied Xdummy from somewhere and

Though it does seem to happen with any two-monitor layout. I can
counteract it by putting *a lot* of empty space between the left and
right monitor, so e.g. putting the right one at pos 5000x0 will force
the tooltips etc. to show up on the right monitor, however this is
undesirable for obvious reasons.

The tooltip/popup you are showing in those screenshots are not managed
windows, so i3 has nothing to do with them. You?ll need to look at the
application in question and/or the toolkit that app uses to figure out
what?s going on.

Right, just checked, and it does indeed *not* happen with QT, it
happens *only* with GTK. So I'll have to look at that. If someone
happens to know anything about it, please let me know.

Sorry for that, but I have been on vacation for the last 12 days or
so... :-)

Yes, just as you describe a few mails later: 00 -> 05 -> 10 -> ...

Anyhow, I don't have a strong opinion about this. I just consider
refreshs that are due to a USR1 "exceptional" and deem the default case
to be more important.
Ultimately, both problems are only aesthetical: ugly numbers vs.
refreshs earlier than <interval>
seconds...<http://dict.leo.org/ende/index_de.html#/search=aesthetical&searchLoc=0&resultOrder=basic&multiwordShowSingle=on>

Hello,

Now I have had time to test and develop more. Initial bugs are fixed.

The repo address is https://github.com/karulont/i3lock-blur/

I also made a release 
https://github.com/karulont/i3lock-blur/releases/tag/2.5.1

For archlinux users as myself I also made an AUR package called i3lock-blur.

Now i3lock-blur is easier for you to test and see if you like it.

Hello Gereon,

thanks for the follow-up.

Your code comment got me in the wrong direction until it dawned on me 
what the purpose of the alignment probably was. That's when I suggested 
alternative approaches to cater for both needs, but Michael did not like 
any of them.

They are exceptional with a vanilla install. They can be quite frequent 
with a customized configuration and I would have found it favorable if 
i3status would be flexible enough to adapt.

For me it's not a matter of aesthetics, but efficiency as my config 
causes USR1 signals quite frequently and the additional refreshes add up 
over time. But it's easy enough to patch and I can live with a custom fork.

Cheers,
   Marco
