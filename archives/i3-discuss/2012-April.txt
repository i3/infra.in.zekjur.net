Subject: [i3] xfce4-notifyd position
Message-ID: <m3bonbortz.fsf@gmail.com>

Hello guys,

First of all, thanks for this great window manager.  I have been using
it for almost 1 week now, and so far it has been really great!

Well, my question has actually been already asked on IRC, but I didn't
have much time to continue the conversation there.  I am using
xfce4-notifyd as my notification daemon, and I've been struggling with
it to get it working properly.  But whenever a notification comes up,
the notification window is displayed in the center of the screen.  I
have always used/configured xfce4-notifyd to make it appear in the top
right, but somehow it's not working with i3.

Some guy (I think it was Fernando) told me that xfce4-notifyd is buggy
regarding to windows' hints, and advised me to use notify-osd instead.
I would happily do that, but I'm on Fedora and (a) I don't have a
package for that and (b) when I tried to compile, I discovered that I
would have to compile another packages for dependencies (because Fedora
also doesn't provide the necessary versions of those).  Anyway, my
question is: is there any way to make xfce4-notifyd work properly and
display notifications wherever I tell it to?

Thank you!

See http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html for how to create a logfile. Provide
the logfile (compressed, and please don?t attach it directly, but upload it
somewhere) and we can tell what?s happening.

Not sure. Have you tried to reproduce this problem in other window managers,
say twm or awesome? If it *only* happens in i3, feel free to file a ticket with
detailed steps on how to reproduce and a full debug level logfile (see
http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html).

I?m sorry, I should have mentioned that patches should be done against the
'next' branch in our git repository. You did yours against the master branch :).

No big deal, though, I?ve merged this into the next branch and your changes are
now online.

Thanks for your contribution!

Thanks, looking forward to add some more :P

Btw, i have the following question, is there a way to be passively notified
of changes on a determined workspace?
For instance, i'm running a console in workspace 3 and it issues a system
bell, i could see the workspace in i3bar with a different color stating
that a window changed...
Not sure if i make my point...

You could do the same as i3bar does: subscribe to the workspace event.

Subject: [i3] i3 4.1: urxvt loses focus after "gitk" ceases on Debian squeeze
Message-ID: <CAB+hAsXk1GGq+dwoc+OebRtjU_sAgsuWTAHdyXA_AhxtQ9rqzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm using Debian squeeze (6.0.4), which is the stable version of
Debian. The i3 package from the official package repository is very
old (3.e) and it will not be updated until next Debian major release.

So I cloned the i3 source, and tried to build it. Some of the
dependent package names listed in the DEPENDS file does not exist in
the stable repository, after some trial and error attempts to grab
dependent packages, I built the package "i3-wm_4.1.2-2_i386.deb" from
the master branch and installed it.

Everything works except that gitk and urxvt do not cooperate well.
When I'm in the urxvt shell, and fire up gitk, then I close gitk (by
pressing Ctrl-W), the starting shell window has no focus and won't
respond to input. And even after I clicked the urxvt window with
mouse, the keyboard strokes still won't be captured by the terminal,
but the mouse can select text, by the way.

The only way to make the terminal aware of keyboard input is switching
to another window or another workspace and then switch back.

I also built the latest urxvt from Debian sid source
(rxvt-unicode_9.15-1_i386.deb), the gitk version is 1.7.2.5-3 (shown
from dpkg -l gitk).

This problem has been annoying me for a long time since I started to
use the latest i3-wm other than the antique one from the stable
repository. And some other programs used to have the same issue but
most of them seemed to be gone (and I don't remember them now anyway)
and now the only case I can confront is "urxvt" and "gitk".

I use both "mrxvt" and "urxvt" (for either multi-tab support or
unicode support...), and "mrxvt" does not have such problem with
"gitk". Actually any program I used to launch from mrxvt terminal did
not cause this problem.

It has focus here and works just fine. I?m using rxvt-unicode-256color 9.15-1
and gitk 1:1.7.9-1.

Maybe you could try upgrading your gitk and/or tcl/tk?

Hi,

I updated "gitk" from 1.7.2.5 to 1.7.9 from the "backport repository"
for Debian stable release. And after a search I see the latest
"tcl/tk" version is 8.6, but that is in the "experimental" release,
and my stable repository only has tk8.4 and tk8.5 ("gitk" package
depends on "tk8.4", so "tk8.4" is automatically installed, and won't
accept "tk8.5"), so I installed tk8.5, and updated "wish" to point to
"/usr/bin/wish8.5". But the problem persists.

This seems to be the tcl/tk problem. As I run "wish" in the urxvt
terminal, I can get a blank GUI window, and after closing the window,
URXVT got no focus, exactly the symptom occurred when I use gitk.

The actual "tk8.5" version is 8.5.8, which is a little older than that
of testing or sid release 8.5.11, so I also build the 8.5.11 sources
and upgrade tcl8.5 & tk8.5, but still no avail.

By the way, I found that there is a "wish8.3" at /usr/local/bin, which
probably was installed by source navigator, running this to get a
blank GUI window and then close it will not cause URXVT freezed. But
the "gitk" script cannot run with this executable...

Is there any other way I can try out?

Regards,
Xia.

I understand how to make applications open on a certain desktop but
would rather have them open on a specific desktop when starting i3 and
then leave me with the option of opening the application on whichever
desktop I choose after that.

I took a stab at it and I tried these but no joy...

exec urxvt assign 2
exec assign [class="URxvt"] 2

Also, thankyou for creating this Window Manager, it's magnificent!
I'm becoming very addicted to it :)

Hi James,

Excerpts from James Robertson's message of 2012-04-13 12:43:17 +0200:

Your application needs to support startup-notifications for that and you need
to use i3 >= v4.1. Just switch to a specific workspace and launch your app
there. "exec i3-msg workspace 2; urxvt" should work. Make sure you have
urxvt >= v9.14 with enabled startup-notifications.

Best regards,
Michael

Thanks!  That certainly works to launch them on startup but I am still
having a bit of problem with the desktops they launch on.

I am using i3 version 4.1.2 (2012-01-27) and urxvt 9.15, I am running
Debian Sid and according the the source package for urxvt
startup-notifications are enabled.  startup-notifications for
Iceweasel (Firefox) 10.0.0.3 are enabled according to it's .desktop
entry.

In my config I have added...

i3-msg workspace WEB ; iceweasel
i3-msg workspace TERM ; urxvt

But when I launch i3 urxvt opens on the same desktop as Iceweasel and
just now when I re-tested it Iceweasel opened on the TERM desktop and
urxvt on the WEB desktop.  This is obviously due to the speed of
launch and they simply end up on the wrong desktop.  As a test I added
these commands to a bash script

> cat .bin/i3startup.sh
#!/bin/bash

i3-msg workspace WEB ; iceweasel
i3-msg workspace TERM ; urxvt

> grep i3startup.sh .config/i3/config
exec i3startup.sh

Iceweasel launches and if I close Iceweasel then urxvt will open.  I
can add an "&" at the end of the Iceweasel line but it has the same
affect as being on the i3 config.

Am I just doing something wrong or perhaps mistaken about the
startup-notification being enabled on these apps?

> i3-msg workspace WEB ; iceweasel
> i3-msg workspace TERM ; urxvt
I?m sorry for instructing you wrong. The application needs to be launched by i3
so that it can match the workspace to the startup notification id. Therefore,
use:

i3-msg workspace WEB; i3-msg exec iceweasel
i3-msg workspace TERM; i3-msg exec urxvt

I added these to my i3 config and some extra's for good measure such
as gimp and further urxvt's but they still end up loading on the wrong
desktops.

I also tested with just urxvt configured to load on each desktop...
they all opened on the same desktop.

Is a spinning/hourglass mouse cursor evidence of the notify event?  I
get this when using dmenu_run but not if I execute the program from
urxvt or xterm.

Is there a way to check if an application uses startupnotify correctly?

Thanks for the help.

I tested it with:

    i3-msg workspace 6 ; i3-msg exec urxvt ; i3-msg workspace 2

Which leads to urxvt starting on workspace 6 while I am seeing workspace 2.
Does that work for you?

Yes that works.  I did a reboot as well to ensure urxvt was loading
it's slowest.

For me it works for urxvt but not for Iceweasel (ver 10.0.3) i. e. after
i3-msg workspace 6 ; i3-msg exec iceweasel ; i3-msg workspace 2
iceweasel appears on workspace 2.

Sorry for jumping in the middle of topic but I would be really interested
to find out how to force Iceweasel to behave.

Cheers,
Piotr

What if you try and get urxvt to load on different desktops?

I presume using that exec line Michael asked me to run is how you
identify if the app uses startupnotify properly?

I had the same behaviour as you for Iceweasel so tried gimp which
seems to use startupnotify properly and this works as expected,
however Gimp would only finish loading once I moved to the desktop it
was on.  This might be to do with the exec line though and will wait
and see what Michael has to say.

The problem with gimp is that it waits until its splash screen is actually
showing (getting mapped on the screen) before it continues loading?

You should report this as a problem at gimp if you need this functionality :).

Thanks for your help Michael,

Using the commands after each other instead of on seperate lines
works!  For example the following opens urxvt on the correct desktops.

exec i3-msg workspace TERM ; i3-msg exec urxvt ; i3-msg workspace EDIT
; i3-msg exec urxvt ; i3-msg workspace MISC ; i3-msg exec urxvt

Iceweasel on Debian Sid is obviously not using startupnotify, I'll
take that up with Debian in a bug report but as long as I keep
Iceweasel as the last program to start I can work around it.

I am not planning on starting Gimp on i3 startup and it's not a show
stopper anyway.

Thanks again!

Message-ID: <CAMALoy8gD+CnT4YT-LztzjcBdy+g+J1G3jUXzhhtMy1sx8zsuw@mail.gmail.com>

I am theming i3 and like slightly transparent backgrounds in my urxvt
terminals and usually have a wallpaper set.

I read the documentation about client.background as I noticed that
urxvt had these areas in my terminals.  These areas grow and shrink by
varying levels when moving/resizing windows which made things look a
little ugly.

I also noticed a similar issue in Gimp.  I am not sure if this is the
same thing.

Is there any way to resolve this?

Here a some links to screenshots to clarify (I have made
client.background = white)

It is. However, in the case of Gimp, the problem is slightly different since
you are dealing with a floating window. In the future, i3 should actually pay
attention to the hints which are set on the window and resize it only in
correct multiples so that you don?t see the problem. In tiling mode the problem
remains, of course.

> Is there any way to resolve this?
Setting the client.background color to some color which comes as close to your
background as possible is the best thing you can do. See also this ticket,
which deals with this problem but in a slightly special context (borderless
windows):

Thanks Michael,

I am far to happy with i3 to let this annoy me.  I will just use
non-transparent black terminals with a black background and forget
about wallpapers.  Probably just need need to kick some of those
floating window manager habits :)

Message-ID: <CAMALoy9=BzxHJkXC-JsBLV+H8OHB=co29Wzi5Nn===gTY+jeAg@mail.gmail.com>

I did a bit of a search through the archives and found this thread:
http://infra.in.zekjur.net/archives/i3-discuss/2012-January/000443.html

It was mentioned that predefined layouts and sessions are planned for
i3 but I was wondering if there is a way to get this functionality
working.

I have a fairly simple desire to start some terminals in a specific
layout but I am having problems getting the layout working.

I want a terminal open on the left of screen in horizontal and 2
terminals open on the right hand side in a vertical split.

Here is what I want to achieve represented in ascii (If it comes out
wrong in your email then below it is a link to an image).

???????????????????????????
?            ?            ?
?            ?            ?
?            ?            ?

?            ?            ?
???????????????????????????

http://ompldr.org/vZGk3Zw

I have tried various options but none work as desired.  for example...

#!/bin/bash

i3-msg split h
i3-msg exec urxvt
i3-msg split v
i3-msg exec urxvt
i3-msg exec urxvt

But only end it with 3 terminals horizontal.  I have tried changing
this with various options and focus. I also ran these on the command
line separated by ";".

Is this because i3-msg is running these commands against the currently
focused window instead of the newly created ones?

Is this possible yet or would I be better waiting until i3 includes
support and try to script it with xdotool?

Thanks

Use:
i3-msg split h
i3-msg exec urxvt
i3-msg exec urxvt
i3-msg split v
i3-msg exec urxvt

That doesn't work and it simply opens 3 terminals vertically for me.
I had a hunch that it was executing faster than urxvt could load and
so added some sleeps as follows:

i3-msg split h
i3-msg exec urxvt
sleep 1
i3-msg exec urxvt
sleep 1
i3-msg split v
i3-msg exec urxvt

This works exactly as intended and the terminals are loaded in the
right positions, albeit slowly...

The following is logged when I run the command with the sleeps:

Apr 25 17:09:46 sidbox x-session: should execute /tmp/foo.sh, no_startup_id = 0

I cannot make out any difference except the execution delay between
them.  Is there anything I can do to troubleshoot this?

You can also separate the commands with a &&: 

i3-msg split h  && \
i3-msg exec urxvt && \
i3-msg exec urxvt  && \
i3-msg split v  && \
i3-msg exec urxvt

Thanks, I just altered the script to test this but does not work for
me either.  I have to have the sleeps.

I also tried using "& wait" at the end of each line but no dice.

I was able to reduce the sleep time to 0.1 and still have it work as
expected but haven't tried from a cold boot yet.

Hi James,

Have you tried something similar to this approach?

Just for the records: I tried something similar a few
days ago and ended up using sleeps between calls to
urxvt as well.

Ah yeah, from me. ;-) Unfortunately this doesn't work if the programs
have all the same class name. For several Terminals I prefer tmux
sessions.

Hi Frank,

Using "--pid" instead of "--classname" for xdotool may solve the
problem for terminals:

#! /bin/sh

# Wait for program
wait_for () {
    echo wait
    n=0
    while true
    do
    if $1; then
        break
    else
        # 10 seconds timeout
        if [ $n -eq 100 ]; then
        xmessage "Error on: $1"
        break
        else
        n=`expr $n + 1`
        sleep .1
        fi
    fi
    done
    sleep 1
}

urxvt &
wait_for "xdotool search --onlyvisible --pid $!"
i3-msg split h
urxvt &
wait_for "xdotool search --onlyvisible --pid $!"
i3-msg split v
urxvt &

Hehe, that sounds very good. I must improve my shell knowledge.

Yep, something I was looking for. I'll test it and then I update my

Message-ID: <20120426145200.GA32491@positivo.my.domain>

Hi i3-discuss@,

I didn't find a way to search in the archives, so I'll ask.

Are there any reasons to shift "right" the classic vi 'hjkl' directions
commands to 'hjk;'? 

There is a historic reason for using 'hjkl':

http://www.catonmat.net/blog/why-vim-uses-hjkl-as-arrow-keys/
http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3684763

Besides this, there is a practical reason too. On a lot of non-US layout
keyboards, ';' doesn't come at the right side of 'k', where 'hjkl' is
almost universal. This makes a pain use i3 with the default conf.

Cheers,

Yes, hjk; is on the homerow, that is, you don't have to take your hands of
your keyboard, while typing, to navigate your windows.

I personally don't care that much about ?historical reasons?, the whole
qwertz-layout-thing is due to ?historical reasons? and it sucks ;)

In the default, i3 should run the configuration-manager at startup. The
default-config uses keycodes and it should use your current keyboard, to
transform that into keysymbols. Therefore the layout you use shouldn't
matter in the default-case. If you switch layouts often, use the
default-default-config (in /etc/i3/config in debian, or in ./i3.config in
the source), it uses keycodes and will therefore automatically adapt to
your needs ;)

The main developer (and the biggest userbase at least in the beginnings
of i3) uses a non-US-layout by the way ;)

Kind regards,

Axel

Message-ID: <CACjNC+qtGMdzMqubkuArAd8UQebYy_KCGc=8Pq17V-6LRg+gsQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm currently trying to configure i3wm to work properly with my multiple
monitor set up.  Yes, I am running a nVidia card and yes I have read "
http://i3wm.org/docs/multi-monitor.html".  I can enable xinerama in X11,
use --force-xinerama with i3 to get xinerama working.

However, I would much rather have separate X screens with Xinerama
disabled, each running their own i3 instance.  In an attempt to try this, I
configured i3 to spawn on each of my DISPLAYs (:0.0 :0.1 :0.2) in my
".xinitrc" file.  This sucessfully spawned i3 instances on each of my X
screens -- however I am experiencing input problems.  Keyboard shortcuts
only seem to work on a single i3 instance.  The other two i3 instances that
are spawned are unusable since one i3 instance catches all of the keyboard
events.

You may be wondering why someone would want Xinerama disabled -- well there
are very few games that support Xinerama and even if they do support
xinerama they will not display correctly with exotic monitor/resolution
configurations.

I use awesome in a similar way -- I spawn awesome on all three x screens
and whichever screen the cursor is on will receive keyboard input.  I'm not
sure if this is something programmed within awesome or something within X,
but would something like this be a possibility for i3?

Regards,
Lukas Sabota

Yes, I know the concept. But, unfortunately and at least in my case, ';'
is not on the homerow.

I don't mind having to adjust .i3/config. What I don't understand is why
is shifted. Is it to make room for Mod+h (horizontal) and make it
coherent?

Sorry, but to me, it doesn't make sense to use 'jkl;' in i3 and jump to
all vi-based apps and use 'hjkl'. Of course, I can configure all
programs to use 'jkl;' too (ksh in vi-mode, vimperator, xxxterm, mutt,
vim itself, muttator, etc.), but this is even more non-sense.

Yes but it's what we have available. I never saw a non-QWERTY layout
with my own eyes.

Axel already mentioned that you should be presented with i3-config-wizard on
your first start of i3, which will generate an i3 config based on keyboard
codes instead of keyboard symbols. So, in that config file, whichever key is on
your homerow ends up being the "focus right" key.

It is shifted because your fingers are supposed to rest in that position.

You could use the arrow keys in these applications. The arrow keys are
comfortable reachable in decent keyboard layouts such as neo-layout.org.

How would you *see* what layout people are using? I don?t care what?s printed

Are you using the latest version of i3? If not, upgrade. If that doesn?t help,
please come to IRC so that we can debug the problem more interactively. Mailing
lists are tedious.

I am using i3-wm 4.2-1 along with xorg 1.12.1 on Arch Linux.  I'm idling in
the channel atm (prg318) .  Hopefully between the two of us and others in
IRC we can diagnose the issue!

See you in IRC!

I think it depends on packaging. On OpenBSD package, I didn't see this,
but I don't care. Really.

I stripped off my arrow keys with a screwdriver. [1]

Me too. Actually, I only remap Tab to be my Esc, and Caps Lock to be my
Control, just like ADM-3A terminal. It's very handy to have Esc closer
to homerow.

Message-ID: <CAC_712oyZQtwk2mxm0WfKM_ODwJvbva+czUBF8ftAHx7nu5o2A@mail.gmail.com>

I've noticed that the reply format for command messages has changed in
4.2-1. It now returns a list with a dictionary as its only element instead
of just a dictionary and empty list for non-existent commands instead of a
dictionary with error message under 'error' key. I've tested this with
i3-msg and also with sockets in Python (i3-py).

Was this intentional or is it going to change back to how it was before? (I
can't find the commit where this was changed.) In my opinion the previous
reply format was more valuable.

For non-existent commands, we should communicate an error. This was an
oversight and will be corrected. Please open a ticket for that.

The new command reply format is intentional and will not change back. Please
note that before 4.2, commands officially had no reply (the documentation was
changed in commit 1f0c0cdd). The reply change was done in commit e114b3dba. The
reason for an array of return values is that you can chain commands like "focus
left; focus down". You are actually running two commands and therefore deserve
to get two return values. To keep things simple, we don?t just return one JSON
object if you run a single command and an JSON array if you run multiple.
Instead, we just always return an JSON array with >= 1 entries.

Best regards,
Michael

Hello,

Michael was nice enough to help me diagnose this issue in IRC and find a
suitable workaround for the issue.  Just to clarify the issue:

After starting i3 on three separate x screens (no xinerama), all keyboard
commands (mod+enter etc) will only trigger events on ONE of the 3 xscreens
regardless of where the cursor was.

A suitable workaround is to use the "swarp" utility.  After moving the
cursor to another xscreen/i3 session using "swarp", the screen can be used
perusual (the screen where the cursor is located will handle the keyboard
events).  For example, after running "startx" my keyboard focus will only
direct to screen :0.0.  After running the following command, keyboard input
will be accept on :0.1 when the cursor is located on that screen:

  DISPLAY=:0.1 swarp 50 50

I plan to work some "swarp" commands into my xinitrc so that after
"startx", input is handled properly.  I hope this may be found useful for
someone in the future with a similar configuration as mine.
