<PRE>I have written my own python script to append a workspace layout to a workspace. As part of this it also creates the workspace on the fly. The script will automatically append a layout to a named workspace and launch applications that will get &quot;swallowed&quot; by that workspace upon launch.

It works fine, except for one small detail. Once the applications get swallowed everything looks fine. I see the applications in their proper layout and I see the toolbar that shows the workspaces (including the newly created one). However as soon as I move the cursor the toolbar disappears (the layout expands to cover it). If I kill the applications in that workspace then the toolbar becomes visible again.

The layout file is generated by another python script that I created. It mimics i3-save-tree (except that it does not have the i3-save-tree bug that I mentioned previously).

I'm sure that I'm doing something slightly wrong with the layout file creation. Yet as I said this mechanism is almost working perfectly. W

What would cause the toolbar to auto-hide?
