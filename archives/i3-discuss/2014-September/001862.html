ok. well.

let's put the - imo quite obvious - use of the nagbar for an exit dialog 
aside for a moment and consider the more usual case of editing something 
inside the i3 config and making an error. or lo and behold starting i3 
with an error already in the config.

if i read that right, it is the intention to force the user to get away 
from the computer, walk through a convention center, ask everyone if she 
has a mouse to spare. or walk to the parking lot to the car and dig 
through the box of odds and ends to see if a mouse is there. or drive to 
the next electronic market and buy a mouse. or a graphic tablet. not 
everyone has an external thinkpad keyboard with integrated nipple.

all that just to be able to read the error message the fully keyboard 
enabled window manager is showing in a big red bar but wont let one see 
until a pointer-enabled HID is attached to the machine.

to phrase it in a very blunt way:

i consider this rather impolite to force a certain type of HID unto the 
user that is uneccessary in all other cases.

yes, there is a logfile etc, but..

and the above mentioned use case is not made up. i am using computers 
without a mouse. except for the case that i was so awesome that i did 
not make an error and did not have to ask a bunch of windows7 laptop 
users if they had a spare mouse. uh.

back to the exit use-case: i have a solution, no harm done. but maybe, 
just maybe it would be very cool and user-friendly to reconsider the 
intentional behaviour of the nagbar.

because, after all.. it is *the* builtin method into i3 to display 
meta-messages and dialogs inside the window manager. last time i checked 
cursor-keys are still available even on apple-keyboards. and shifting 
focus to the nagbar would be more inline with nagging the user. and more 
so without breaking usability.

just my 2ct.

cheers,
grubernd
