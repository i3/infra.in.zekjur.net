<PRE>I am building some automation to be used with i3, with an eye towards remote management of a suite of i3 desktops.

I am using the latest i3 (4.8). I need to make the design decision to use high level tools such as &quot;i3-save-tree&quot;, or to build my own &quot;tree parsing/manipulation tools&quot;.

I would like to understand how stable the tree structure is. If its relatively stable, then I think its pretty safe to build my own tools that work with the i3 tree. Future changes to the tree would be something that I can work with in this case. However if the tree is expected to change a lot then perhaps I don’t want to build my own tools that work with the tree structure.

In a sense I am wondering if I should treat the tree structure (and specification) as a &quot;public&quot; or a &quot;private&quot; spec. Certainly for a given i3 release I can treat it as public, but I don’t want to create automation that will become obsolete with future releases of i3. 

Id appreciate any thoughts or recommendations.
