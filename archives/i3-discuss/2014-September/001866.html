</I>&gt;<i> mind: nagbar should nag. but in my opinion it should not be the only tool

</I>It doesn’t require a mouse. You can just kill it. Or fix the error in
your config file and run “i3 reload”. Or (for the use case of exiting
your session) run “i3 exit”, or just shut down your computer, or
terminate the X session otherwise.

There are plenty of alternatives, but they are not as convenient as
just using nagbar when having a mouse attached. Similarly, i3 comes
with a resize mode configured by default (keyboard shortcuts), yet
resizing with a mouse is typically more convenient.

i3’s line of thinking doesn’t dictate the keyboard as the one and only
input device in all situations. We encourage you to use whichever
input device is the most appropriate. For most window management
operations, that’s clearly the keyboard, for resizing that’s most
often the mouse, for nagging users that’s clearly the mouse :).

Also note that nagbar is _not_ a generic tool to display dialogs that
is well integrated into i3. Its purpose really is to nag you about
config errors (so that you don’t nag us in our support channels) and
before exiting a session accidentally. For the latter, you are
expected to eventually change your config to bypass nagbar entirely.

I don’t want to shut you up, but after this reply I don’t think
there’s a lot to talk about anymore. I get that you don’t like the
situation as-is, but the nagbar concept works very well for all other
users that I’ve talked to, and it is very unlikely to change.
