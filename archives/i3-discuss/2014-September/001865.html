i have a better hack:

sudo mv /usr/bin/i3-nagbar /usr/bin/i3-nagbar-no

&gt;<i> Yes, nobody likes nagbar.
</I>
and here we have a misunderstanding. i like nagbar, because it would be 
a very elegant way of displaying dialogs inside the window manager 
without resorting to extra tools like dialog, ncurses, gtk, or whatever.

&gt;<i> Nagbar is meant to be a teaching tool for new users.

ouch. see engineering below..

&gt;<i> It appears when you have a syntax error in your config file or duplicate
</I>&gt;<i> binding. It's there to warn you about the default key combination that
</I>&gt;<i> exits the wm so you don't press it on accident for the first time. If
</I>&gt;<i> your config file is free of errors, you should never see it.
</I>
i am really glad that the designers of most software dont follow your 
line of thought. imagine all software would display funky big bars that 
*do not follow their own design paradigm* and force you to use a 
differnt interface than they usually do.


&gt;<i> One thing that I don't like about some desktop environments is that they
</I>&gt;<i> are too talky. There is always something flashing in the corner or some
</I>&gt;<i> popup notification that I don't care about on my screen. i3 is designed
</I>&gt;<i> to be quiet.
</I>
yes, and that's a good thing. i dont want i3 to talk more. but here's 
the thing: i3 already has a method to display user-initiated system 
dialogs, aka &quot;the nagbar&quot;, but they do not follow the general design 
paradigm of keyboard-centered control. and that is the thing i am trying 
to get across. i3 doesnt follow it's own rules.

&gt;<i> There is no other window manager &quot;meta information&quot; that
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be displayed in nagbar other than config errors. This is good
</I>&gt;<i> unix engineering.
</I>
i dont know too much about good _unix_ engineering, but good engineering 
doesnt get in the way of the user and changes behaviour midway.

mind: nagbar should nag. but in my opinion it should not be the only 
tool that requires a very specific type of hardware to be attached to 
the computer. that's all i am saying.

cheers,
grubernd
