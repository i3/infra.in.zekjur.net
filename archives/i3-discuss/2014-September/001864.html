<PRE>Here you go: `bindsym $mod+Escape pkill i3-nagbar`.

Yes, nobody likes nagbar. But I don't think that there is any reason to 
change it. Nagbar is meant to be a teaching tool for new users. It 
appears when you have a syntax error in your config file or duplicate 
binding. It's there to warn you about the default key combination that 
exits the wm so you don't press it on accident for the first time. If 
your config file is free of errors, you should never see it.

One thing that I don't like about some desktop environments is that they 
are too talky. There is always something flashing in the corner or some 
popup notification that I don't care about on my screen. i3 is designed 
to be quiet. There is no other window manager &quot;meta information&quot; that 
needs to be displayed in nagbar other than config errors. This is good 
unix engineering.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, there is a logfile etc, but..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and the above mentioned use case is not made up. i am using computers

</I>&gt;<i> not make an error and did not have to ask a bunch of windows7 laptop 
</I>&gt;<i> users if they had a spare mouse. uh.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> back to the exit use-case: i have a solution, no harm done. but maybe, 
</I>&gt;<i> just maybe it would be very cool and user-friendly to reconsider the 
</I>&gt;<i> intentional behaviour of the nagbar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> because, after all.. it is *the* builtin method into i3 to display 
</I>&gt;<i> meta-messages and dialogs inside the window manager. last time i 
</I>&gt;<i> checked cursor-keys are still available even on apple-keyboards. and 
</I>&gt;<i> shifting focus to the nagbar would be more inline with nagging the 
</I>&gt;<i> user. and more so without breaking usability.
</I>&gt;<i>
