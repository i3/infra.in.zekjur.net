<PRE>If you can reproduce this, file a bugreport with the layout file
you’re using at <A HREF="http://bugs.i3wm.org/">http://bugs.i3wm.org/</A>

i3bar is placed in a dock container, perhaps in your situation the
container type is not properly set up…

&gt;<i> I have written my own python script to append a workspace layout to a workspace. As part of this it also creates the workspace on the fly.

</I>&gt;<i> It works fine, except for one small detail. Once the applications get swallowed everything looks fine. I see the applications in their proper layout and I see the toolbar that shows the workspaces (including the newly created one). However as soon as I move the cursor the toolbar disappears (the layout expands to cover it). If I kill the applications in that workspace then the toolbar becomes visible again.
