You're trying to control a Firefox instance titled &quot;YouTube.&quot; Assuming Flash was
involved wasn't much of a stretch.

You say you've tried this with Chromium with &quot;greater succcess,&quot; which is to say
incomplete success. What exactly are you trying to do? How has using Chromium
gotten you close to that than using Firefox? It's always wise to explain what
your end-goal is when asking someone for what you believe will be the answer.
