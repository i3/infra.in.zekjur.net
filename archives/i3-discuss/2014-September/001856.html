<PRE>A few months ago I came back to I3 after having tried a few other things (KDE
again, tried Awesome).  But in the end I just really kept wanting to come back
to I3.

However, one thing that Awesome had that I'm really missing from I3 is an
ability to re-tile a bunch of windows.  In particular, I often run &quot;cssh&quot;
which opens 15 to 30 windows, and I'm manually going in and moving them left
or right to get them into a 3 or 4 different columns.  It sure would be nice
if there was a way to say &quot;Reflow all my windows into 4 columns, evenly&quot;.

With Awesome it is more of a stack, and you have the &quot;primary&quot; window, so it
is easy enough to move things up and down that stack, so it isn't a big deal
how it orders the windows.  But in this case, I really don't care how it
orders them.

I will admit that I kind of missed the &quot;primary window&quot; idea and the ability
to swap things with the primary window.  But mostly what I'm doing right now
is to either &quot;full screen&quot; the window I want to focus on, or I switch the
container layout so that it becomes full height -- which means I lose other
windows in that stack, but I still have other stacks I can use for viewing on
the screen while in my &quot;primary&quot; window.

Anyway, I'm wondering what the right approach would be to get this re-flowing
to happen.  Would it be something internal to i3, where maybe there are a few
layouts you could choose from?  Or is this doable from an external script?  I
haven't done any i3 external scripting before.

Thanks,
Sean
