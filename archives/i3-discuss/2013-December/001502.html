<PRE>Hi,

I have been working on layout/session saving/restoring this
weekend. The title is a mouthful, but what it&#8217;s about is saving parts of
your layout (say, an entire workspace) to a JSON file and later loading
that into i3.

This is useful for multiple things:

1) Restoring a certain layout when starting up your x session.
   People used to do this with shell scripts and hacks such as
   i3-exec-wait until now.

2) Defining a more elaborate default layout for certain workspaces. As
   an example, on my big screen I like to have three columns of stacked
   containers with terminals in them, where the middle one is larger
   than the left and right ones.

I uploaded a video to demonstrate how it looks:
<A HREF="http://youtu.be/CaDOfwxXc9g">http://youtu.be/CaDOfwxXc9g</A>

To save a layout, there is i3-save-tree(1), which requires the Perl
modules AnyEvent::I3&#185; and JSON::XS&#178;. i3-save-tree --workspace=1 prints
workspace 1&#8217;s layout to stdout. You are expected to edit that layout
file briefly, especially the &#8220;swallows&#8221; sections of each container. The
criteria should be familiar to you, e.g. from for_window.

Once you have done that, you can use the append_layout command to load a
layout file.

As for the code, I just pushed the branch &#8220;session-saving&#8221;, which you
can build and use right now. It&#8217;s stable enough that I&#8217;m using it on my
main machine. But, since this is a very new feature, be prepared to
encounter some stability issues (e.g. layout files that could crash
i3). You have been warned! :)

Also note that I reserve the right to break this feature in any way that
I deem necessary, and you have no right to complain about layout file or
new command breakage :).

As for the release plan: I intend to release i3 4.7 soonish (maybe in a
week or so). After that is done, I&#8217;ll merge the session-saving branch
into the &#8220;next&#8221; branch, i.e. the earliest i3 release that can possibly
have this feature will be 4.8.
