Hi Michael,

Likewise, thanks for the explanation.

I'll just drop what I had in mind in here in case someone else is interested to
whip up the script before I can get on with it.

I imagine that the script would have to handle two floating windows in order to
avoid further resizing after the initial setup. It should just basically move
and resize the windows to their places and bind a key to toggle them.
