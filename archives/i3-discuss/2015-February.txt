Subject: [i3] All i3 git repositories are now on GitHub
Message-ID: <CANnVG6kBxOf=qyBX9s963Dx5tA8wATpG7MhsDZOW0f8o5PxADQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

For various reasons, I’d like to minimize the number of critical
services I host (and the number of custom solutions for common tasks).
Therefore, I’ve moved all i3 repositories to GitHub.

Instead of submitting patches on cr.i3wm.org, please send a pull
request for the corresponding repository on https://github.com/i3.

http://bugs.i3wm.org is now a redirect to
https://github.com/i3/i3/issues, and all existing tickets have been
imported.

I’ll keep the existing repository locations around as best-effort
mirrors (which automatically pull from GitHub). All past reviews on
cr.i3wm.org are kept so that history stays available.

Best regards,
Michael

Subject: [i3] Assign workspaces to outputs dynamically.
Message-ID: <54E3A391.1000401@gmail.com>

Hi,

I use my laptop in three different environments with different randr 
outputs enabled.
I often switch between environments, and could not configure i3 to place 
my workspaces on the desired outputs.
My randr configuration is updated automatically on udev drm change 
events with autorandr <http://github.com/wertarbyte/autorandr>.
Is there some way to specify dynamic output bindings ?

My three environments are pretty simple :

 1. /Nomad (undocked)/
      * eDP1 connected primary ← all workspaces
 2. /Docked/
      * eDP1 connected ← workspace 0
      * DP1-1 connected primary ← all other workspaces
 3. /Presentation/
      * VGA1 connected ← workspace 0
      * eDP1 connected primary ← all other workspaces

My current config works for situation 1 and 2 :

|workspace 0 output eDP1

workspace 1 output DP1-1
workspace 2 output DP1-1
workspace 3 output DP1-1
workspace 4 output DP1-1
workspace 5 output DP1-1
workspace 6 output DP1-1
workspace 7 output DP1-1
workspace 8 output DP1-1
workspace 9 output DP1-1
workspace 10 output DP1-1
|

This is already a hack because the configuration describes the /Docked/ 
configuration.
It incidentally works when /Undocked/ because there is only one output, 
and all workspaces are mapped to it.

It does not work at all for my presentation.

One solution that would suit me would be to extend the |workspace <x> 
output| command to support multiple outputs in order of preference.
for example, |worspace 0 output(s) VGA1 eDP1| would place workspace 0 on 
the projector when available, and on eDP1 otherwise.

Do you find this useful ?

Layus.

fwiw, I use a script that detects things like which monitor is connected,
and falls back to certain defaults, or can be forced to e.g. VGA display
etc.

Subject: [i3] Code for titlebar borders
Message-ID: <20150220161654.GA3723@workbox.Home>

Howdy-ha, all. This message is basically a rehash of a question I asked on the
FAQ.[1] It didn't get any responses, so I'm just giving this list a shot to see
if anyone can point me in the right direction.

I'm looking for the portion of the i3 source code that controls the thickness
(height) of the titlebar borders, in the hopes of increasing that thickness. The
goal is to make the border slight thicker in order to make it more prominent,
making it another indicator of the focus status of a window rather than a mere
aesthetic supplement to the background color of the window's titlebar (although
I also think it would look nice; it's not *just* a practical thing ;) ).

I'm not much of a coder, so the closest related thing I've found that seems
relevant is the following snippet from '<i3_source_root>/src/x.c':

> /* 5: draw two unconnected horizontal lines in border color */
> xcb_change_gc(conn, parent->pm_gc, XCB_GC_FOREGROUND, (uint32_t[])
> {p->color->border});
> Rect *dr = &(con->deco_rect);

>         deco_diff_r = 0;

>     dr->x - deco_diff_r + dr->width - 1,
>     dr->y + dr->height - 1}};
> xcb_poly_segment(conn, parent->pixmap, parent->pm_gc, 2, segments);

This mostly seems to control the position and padding of the border, but not its
thickness/height, so I feel like it's the wrong place to look.  If anyone can
either correct me if I'm wrong or let me know where in the code to look, I'd
appreciate it.  Thanks for your time; take care.

I'd like to use I3 and emacs. I don't have a spare modifier key on my
keyboard, so I'd like to use a prefix key. Maybe I missed it in the docs,
in which case, please accept my apologies. (I've only just begun to look at
the source.)

1. Is there support for this currently in I3?

2. If not, is there interest in a patch?

Are you aware of
http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_border_style_for_new_windows,
specifically something like “new_window pixel 4”?

To answer your actual question: I think
https://github.com/i3/i3/blob/fbe25297b7921c390bcdac846710667fc04569f8/src/con.c#L1130
is what you’re looking for.

For the level of customization you describe, you’ll need to create a
simple script that generates/puts together your config file. See e.g.
https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1367/anyway-to-include-in-config-file/

Hi,

The configuration directive |workspace 1 output DP1-1| seems to have no 
“command” counterpart.
(i.e. i3-msg workspace 1 output DP1-1 creates a new workspace named “1 
output DP1-1”)

This means that I am unable to remap dynamically workspaces to outputs.
Am I missing some option or should I fill a feature request/provide a 
patch ?

@Serge:
Thank you for your response.

I have looked into autorandr, and it does indeed provide a postswitch hook.
I have added some reconfiguration for i3 there (see my postswitch file 
https://gist.github.com/layus/89a6bb8feebe6c1f96d2)

Regards,
Layus

It does, see http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_moving_containers_workspaces_to_randr_outputs

@Michael,

You mean that I should rewrite .i3/config and reload (restart?) i3 every 
time I detect a monitor change, right ?

This seems a bit overkill but might just work.
I will try that on Monday.

Correct. I’m not sure if reload does the trick or if a restart is
required. In case reload is not sufficient, I bet TonyC is interested
in fixing that ;).

Yes I am. I'm referring to the two horizontal lines drawn across the top and
bottom edges of the titlebar (affected by the "border" color setting), *not* the
container frame (affected by the "background" color setting). Confusion no doubt
arises from the fact that "border" has two distinct meanings in i3 parlance.

Hey,

it’s been quite a while since the i3 4.8 release, so it’s time to do
another release soon :).

If you are not running a version of i3 built from the “next” branch,
please upgrade and help us test :). You can check which version you
are running by using i3 --moreversion. See also
http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html

To obtain a version built from “next”, check out
http://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html if you are using Debian or a
derivative. For Arch Linux (and possibly others), install i3-git.

In case you encounter any bug that wasn’t there in 4.8, please report
it at https://github.com/i3/i3

I’m planning to release in a week from now, i.e. on 2015-02-28.

Thanks!

Is there a quick solution to compile the latest i3 on debian/wheezy?

| ../i3/src/bindings.c:11:33: fatal error: xkbcommon/xkbcommon.h: Datei
| oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden

Seems xkbcommon is not available for wheezy and there is no backport.

Not that I know of. I might create a backport once 4.9 is actually released.

Hi Michael,

Builds and runs in Arch 64 current to commit d5ec59e ("Merge pull
request #1486 from acrisci/feature/docs-xvfb-tests") using the
stock i3-git PKGBUILD from the AUR.[1]

Is there any particular functionality you would like tested or
additional information regarding my setup you would find useful?

Regards,

[1] Note that the Arch PKGBUILD requires xcb-util-cursor-git and thus
xcb-util-cursor is the git version current to commit f03cc27 ("darwin:
Use OSByteOrder.h rather than CF").

Hi Michael and all,

I have just tried to test i3-next on my Slackware system. The error I

See https://github.com/i3/i3/blob/next/DEPENDS — I think your version
of libxkbcommon is too old.

PS : No bug yet with the "next" branch :)
