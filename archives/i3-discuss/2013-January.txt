Historical reasons: ?degraded? was introduced later than ?bad?.

This error indicates that the font you specified in the configuration
file is not actually installed.

In case you are using the default config, install the Debian package
xfonts-base.

i3-wm has ?Recommands: xfonts-base? so I suppose you disabled
recommendations in apt.

Hi,

imho there's no need to copy so much for the ipc magic code.

This sync libi3/ipc_send_message.c with what i3bar/src/ipc.c does.

Hi, That's not how strncpy works. The third argument to strncpy is there to
prevent the buffer from overflowing. Use strncpy with buffer_size - 1 as
the third argument unless you know what you're doing.


This sync libi3/ipc_send_message.c with what i3bar/src/ipc.c does.
>

That code is using strncpy the wrong way. It's also incorrectly passing len
to strncpy, as the walk pointer has advanced and len hasn't been updated.
While that won't make i3bar crash if the math there is right, it's not
really correct code. Check with Michael first, but I believe he would
accept a patch that fixes that.

Regards,

Actually, looking at it again, len = strlen(payload), so len is fine as
it's what's left in the buffer. The first strncpy is still wrong, though.

I3_IPC_MAGIC is:

#define I3_IPC_MAGIC "i3-ipc"

And then you have:

int buffer_size = strlen(I3_IPC_MAGIC) + sizeof(uint32_t) +
sizeof(uint32_t) + message_size;
char msg[buffer_size];
char *walk = msg;
strncpy(walk, I3_IPC_MAGIC, strlen(I3_IPC_MAGIC));
...

So imho it's not possible to overflow the buffer here.

Btw, I think the "big plan" is to make i3bar use the IPC related
functions from libi3, instead of rolling its own, to avoid code
duplication. I think this happened because i3bar initially was a
third-party project that later got merged into i3.

Cheers,
David

That doesn't matter. strncpy is designed to prevent buffer overflows. If
you don't specify buffer_size - 1, you're misusing it.

If you don't care about overflows, use strcpy instead, or even memcpy. But
you have to have a reason to get rid of the buffer overflow protection
(e.g., this is a hot code path that *needs* to be optimized and strncpy
*is* the bottleneck).

Even though there's no buffer overflow possibility now, it's unlikely, but
maybe some day there will be. Or maybe this code will get copied and pasted
somewhere where there might be a buffer overflow. strncpy just makes sense,
you need a reason to replace it with strcpy.

Yep, that sounds great to me.

Hi Fernando, David,

I have pushed a commit which uses an entirely different way of
formatting the message and sending it: http://c.i3wm.org/7b0d75e, see
http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/tree/libi3/ipc_send_message.c?h=next
for the new code.

While the two loops are somewhat ugly (see the comment), at least we
don?t allocate a variable amount of stack memory anymore and save all
those strncpy() and memcpy() calls :-).

Michael

Hi Emil,

This sounds amazing. Especially the suspend/resume support.

I already have a setup for Gnome/i3 similar to the one I described here:

I'll be patching your version in my laptop, and give it a try.
Anything particular you'd like me to pay attention too/for?

Subject: [i3] Color of border of windows title
Message-ID: <50F8535A.5010905@gmail.com>

Hi,

I use i3. First of all, good job. What I like of i3 is the possibility 
of having Mod + W mode in which all windows are "separated". I think 
this marks the difference between other tilling WM and i3. Moreover, the 
wizard and selection of Mods keys and easy combination of Mod+Return is 
good (other tilling wm make you type complicated sequence of keys). Ah!, 
and Mod+d is awesome! ;-)

Well, I just want to know how can I change the color of the borders of 
window title (in Mod+W mode). I see there is a grey (possibly 1px) 
segments. I just see in in Mod+w mode (nope in Mod+e...). In Mod+s also 
it appears.

I read the docs, and no mention of that.

Thanks in advance,
Xan.

?Note that for the window decorations, the color around the child window
is the background color, and the border color is only the two thin lines
at the top of the window.?

My words are a quote from that section of the userguide.

The answer to your question is ?yes?, but you could also just have tried
it yourself?

Funny, I didn?t even know about ?command? until now! :-)

Could you please re-submit your patches using ?git format-patch? and

Subject: [i3] Setup layout beforehand
Message-ID: <CALqes9-4+cSAVTcXgbP_bQ4Y9Q9cRsn5HC0Q1=ZpZ-KNvXXEGQ@mail.gmail.com>

I use VMD, a program with multiple windows that must be launched from a
terminal.

When it starts two windows are opened instantly giving me no time to switch
the layout beforehand. Assuming a new workspace, I want to launch VMD, hide
the terminal (put in stack or tabbed mode) and set the remaining windows in
horizontal mode.

Simply put, I need to open an terminal and launch VMD (two windows
simultaneously). My desired layout is:

      stack
     /     \
terminal  h-split
           /   \
         VMD1 VMD2

Hello.

I guess your question is: ?How to get this layout before launching VMD??
I think it's not possible (though I may be wrong,
since I don't know if layout saving is implemented),
but I can tell you how to get this layout after launching the program.

1. With open terminal, switch to stacked mode (?layout tabbed?)
2. Launch VMD
3. With one of the VMD's windows focussed, split horizontally (?splith?)
4. Focus the other VMD's window (probably ?focus left?)
5. Move the window into the split window (probably ?move right?)

Putting a for_window with splith command into your config
could help to do this automatically for two windows,
but that's a really ugly workaround.

Before you start to fiddle with your configuration,
can you tell why that program has to be launched from the terminal?
If it doesn't require input and it doesn't output important data,
I don't see the need for it to be launched from the terminal.

Great, this works.

It has very little use as it has a dedicated Tk console window, but
only there
some error explanations are showed. Earlier versions didn't require the
terminal open, now it simply didn't starts without it.

I tried to disown the program, but it closes?! Do you know how to circumvent
this?

Best regards.

You can use nohup, dtach, probably some multiplexers like tmux, screen?
When using nohup you can get the output again with ?tail -f nohup.out?.
Refer to the manpages of the commands for information about using them.

Good luck. ;-)

Message-ID: <CABf5LwBRczVixnvVD1G1RaQQTjm_F3y_ptmT0xO+MdxZg6jDuw@mail.gmail.com>

at this moment i3wm has 4 layouts: 1. splitv 2. splith 3. tabbed 4. stacked.

But I think we should remove 1 and 2 because this default setting
 is useless. Our screen has limited width or height, so splitting more
than 2 times will make nothing readable.

Instead, I purpose complete binary tree model. this will replace the
default 1 and 2.

the new behaviour for splitv will be like this if I have 4 windows opened:

          v
       h    h
     1  3 2  4

the new behaviour for splith is simply:
           h
       v    v
     1  3 2  4


when we insert a new node (windows) for splith
           h
       v    v
     h  3 2  4
    1 5

if you are curious, how we get 1324 instead of 1234:

     h
    1 2

     h
   v  2
  1 3

          h
       v    v
     1  3 2  4

There are usecases where more than 2 splits are fine and useable.
On my big 1920x1080 monitor I can comfortably use 3 or 4 columns
depending on what I'm doing.

And it looks like you're assuming that the splits are always evenly
sized which is not the case. Think for example about a small column
which contains pidgin's buddy list. Then on most displays there's still
enough place for two other columns.

So I'm against removing splitv and splith. But I don't have anything
against adding your suggestion as an _additional_ layout.

BTW. didn't i3 have at one point the behaviour that it would toggle
between splitv and splith depending on which side was bigger? Or am I
confusing this with another window manager?

I have a slightly larger screen so I enjoy a 3x2 grid. Cognitive
psychology argues our short-term memory can only efficiently manage no
more than seven objects anyway. So I propose 6 windows in a workspace
should be enough for common use cases.

Given no more than 6 windows, there are only a few types of layout to choose.

> Instead, I purpose complete binary tree model. this will replace the

I do like the idea to allow user to fine-grain tune the layout with
tree structure that describes the position of each window. i3's layout
commands are powerful, but so far I feel manual layout management at
runtime counterproductive. I have a lot of time thinking about layout
preference, but when I'm using it, I just want to $mod+Return to make
windows pop up immediately and start working. So it would be ideal if
I can save my layout preference in configuration and stop worrying
about it at runtime.

Hi,

I'm not too fond of this binary tree idea: It has no real gain (at least 
not for me), as it can't do anything one could not achieve with a single 
keystroke before opening a new window. (i.e. switching to splitv / 
splith). But it takes aways some possibilities, for example having more 
than two containers each taking the full height.

I also thought about presets, as "presets for workspace layouts" is one 
feature I really miss in i3. What I'd like to have is the following:
My workspace 1 always contains pidgin (left, ~20%) and thunderbird 
(right, rest of screen). I have not yet been able to create a config 
such that when I start those programs (in arbitrary order) they are 
placed as described.
I guess it'd need some kind of "want have"-size, such that when a 
container has the possibility to resize (because a new container 
appeared), it resizes to the "want have"-size (or some intermediate 
values, if multiple "want have"-sizes do not allow for an "optimal" 
placement.
Maybe, we should fork this thread? :-)

That sounds like an interesting idea. We do call our client-window
buckets 'containers', so there's nothing that stops someone from going
off and implementing something like CSS width/height specifiers with
values that are either (a) a percentage of the screen size, or (b) a
percentage of the parent container size.

Then an appropriately written for_window rule would be able to apply
startup size hints on a per-application basis, e.g.:

    # Start pidgin windows at 20% of parent container width and full
    # screen height, if possible.
    for_window [class="Pidgin"] width='0.20' screen_height="100%"

Implementing the full blown layout specifications possible with CSS
would probably be overkill, but I am guessing we can go a very long way
without _all_ the bells and whistles.  Even with just _one_ size-related
hint, that depends on parent container size, we can do a lot of stuff.

1. I dont think there is a option for auto toggle between splitv and
splith. maybe you mean default_orientation auto? but it is statically
determined by the screen size in the beginning. (p.s. maybe awesome
wm?)

2. I forget to talk about the benefits in my last post. let's analyze a bit:
* when we continuously use mod+ return, both stacking and tabbed
result in a readable window size. however splitvh does not. I know
someone mentioned that if the screen is large enough, you can actually
split 3 or 4 times. but the property of complete binary tree is that
all windows (except those in the deepest level) should have about the
same window size. if you keep splitting more windows, the property
ensures that all windows do not get ridiculously tall or fat. (if you
still want to split 3, 4 times, you can manually move the new windows.
but i dont think cbtree is less readable.)

* as mentioned, this actually benefits people who have smaller screen
(12 in x 8 in) like me. I cannot do splitv because this makes windows
too fat, one splith is ok but more than that makes the windows too
thin. because i have to move things around, this is
counter-productive. (I now stay with tabbed, but by default it is hard
to look at 2 windows together)

* split v and split h comment is still there. but by default splitv
splith orientation are not that useful (for reason above).  The
purpose of default orientation is that it reduces work for users, so
cbtree model is just about right.

Hi Tai-Lin,

Your proposal is an interesting thought experiment, but as pointed out
by others in this thread, I think it neglects some use cases.

Additionally, introducing _yet another_ layout mode is really not
something I am interested in doing. I think i3 already offers a lot of
ways in which it can be used, possibly even too many already.

Since you mention that you find i3?s way of managing windows rather
counter-productive, I?d recommend looking at automatic tiling window
managers such as XMonad, which I hear is very customizable, too, so
maybe that is a better base for your idea.

Sorry for taking so long to respond to your mail.

It seems like you did not use git to create these patches. Could you
please do that and then submit your patches to http://cr.i3wm.org/?

after I read the bug tracker, I still think it is possible to
implement this feature.

I liked the idea of using w/h > 1? splith : splitv to implement this
because this allows us to existing feature and will not introduce too
much new things.

anyone?

Hi Tai-Lin, 

I don't know what you are talking about. Two times 'this' without
providing context. Leave at least the email header intact if you are
picking up an old discussion. And provide links to stuff you refer
to. Thanks. 

As from what I _guess_ to be what you're desiring: Isn't the `layout
toggle split`-command ($mod+e in current default config) enough for a
manual tiler? 

Cheers, 

	joep

Hi Michael,

I also would like to have such feature in my i3status and sometime ago I
made a similar change, adding CFGF_MULTI to time config, but I didn't
submit a patch because I knew it would be rejected because this breaks
compatibility with existing config files.

Is there any chance of some variation of it be accepted? Maybe a new module
just for that? The existing "time" module would remain intact (maybe
sharing some code with the new module) and the new module would always
require a timezone, maybe as its title. It can be named "tz_time" or
something like that.

Regards,
Marcelo

Using a new module is definitely the way to go. Nevertheless, I don?t
really want to add such a feature. As I mentioned in the review, it?s
_trivial_ to achieve this with a simple wrapper script, after all you
just need a ?TZ=foo date? call. Having it in i3status itself is far more
complex and I?m not convinced that this is worth the effort.

Hi Michael,

I would like to see something like this in i3status. My current setup
shows three different time zones using your approach but if I have an
option to setup it up inside i3status would be nicer...

A simple wrapper script won't preserve the formatting magic, and will be
even less efficient than the tz_set() juggling.

I really need multiple clocks, but ultimately it's your call, and I
appreciate that you're trying to keep i3status minimal and efficient.

If you change your mind, let me know and I can rework the patch to use a
different module name or whatever will make it less offensive. :)

I'm just a casual i3 lover who likes to see updates. As an ex-pat, multiple
time zone clocks would make my life.

It does; we have examples for how to properly wrap i3status in its
contrib/ folder.

Given that a few other people haven spoken up stating they need the
feature, too, I?m willing to give a new patch a chance. I suggest
?tztime? as module name. Please make it as efficient as the old ?time?
module currently is. Once you are done, submit it to http://cr.i3wm.org/

I stand corrected.

(last time I played this game, I wrote a *cough* much simpler one) :)

How about this: http://cr.i3wm.org/patch/27

I added some debugging printfs() (not included in the patch) and verified
that it doesn't call tzset() unnecessarily. (I'm hoping this is what you
meant by efficient)

Not an immediate solution for you, but when i3status didn't do what I
wanted I wrote a simple replacement[1] in Python. It's messy and much of
the use of sub-shells should be replaced, but it's a conversion of an
older script and works for now.
