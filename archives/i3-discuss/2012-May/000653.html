<PRE>Hi,

On Sun, May 6, 2012 at 3:39 AM, DR &lt;<A HREF="http://infra.in.zekjur.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/i3-discuss">drdarkraven at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

</I>
That does make a bit more sense, but it's still confusing. So your
all-in-one patch is all patches in the 1-5 sequence? I'm assuming then
that 1, 2 and 3 never got merged. Do you know why? Would it be better
to merge them first?

If some of those patches fixes something from some previous patch(es)
and none of those got merged yet, please fix your history by rebasing
interactively first, then post the patches. The patches should be
self-contained in the sense that they do a coherent chunk of changes.

As an example of why your commit messages are currently not good
enough, consider this:

* 4/5: Avoid potential race conditions &lt;- In which case those race
conditions occur?

* 5/5: Improve event processing a bit &lt;- What is being improved? It
looks like the IPC interface is being changed.

Again, if you're changing the IPC protocol, you've got to explain
what's the use case and whether or not your change will break
anything.

Please consider the following: Rewrite your history, dividing the
patches into self-contained chunks of code. Use individual threads for
things that are not related. If the patches need to be applied in
order, but aren't related, you might prefer to post the first
patchset, wait for it to be reviewed and possibly merged, then post
the second, and so on. And please use more detailed descriptions in
the body of the commit message where necessary.

I'm sorry if I'm being pedantic here, but this would make it much
easier to review your patches.

Regards,
</PRE>
