<PRE>Hi Xia,

Thanks for your feedback. Some comments in-line:

&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> There is no harm installing i3-wm beside your normal Ubuntu GNOME
</I>&gt;<i> desktop environment. You can choose the i3 session at GDM login
</I>&gt;<i> screen. And try out various applications, whatever it comes from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My initial i3 experience was on a laptop installed Xubuntu, that is
</I>&gt;<i> Ubuntu with Xfce desktop environment, because I was heard that Ubuntu
</I>&gt;<i> may have a wider support of different hardwares. Switching to a tiling
</I>&gt;<i> window manager was very pleasant. Later I got a desktop computer to
</I>&gt;<i> work with, and I installed Debian.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For Debian, you can only install a base system, and reboot to your new
</I>&gt;<i> system, then choose exactly those packages you need. Xorg + i3 will
</I>&gt;<i> suffice, no GNOME, no KDE. But I installed &quot;Thunar&quot;, the GUI file
</I>&gt;<i> manager from Xfce, which can help me automatically mount a USB stick
</I>&gt;<i> when it's plugged in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's one of the ideas I had in mind... Debian or Arch, but I am more
tended to Debian because I am so used to Aptitude and the deb packages...


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point is you choose the appropriate application to your liking,
</I>&gt;<i> e.g., wicd-curses or nm-applet to manage your network, or just use
</I>&gt;<i> static network setup like I'm doing in my Debian system; and I like to
</I>&gt;<i> use alsamixer to control the volumes in the terminal, but obviously
</I>&gt;<i> there are a lot of different applets to achieve this same task.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think you are totally right... as a newbie in the i3wm, I wanted to get
everyone's opinion and experience with it, so I don't go through the
hardest way of doing things... Just by reading everyone's comments here, I
already found some issues on my own to solve.

Do you have any issues with keyrings? No one commented about it, but, for
example in my case, if I don't have the gnome-keyring-daemon running, other
applications that store passwords simply don't work (eg. wicd, polly,
empathy, pidgin, etc), well, they do work, but they do not store the
password, so if you restart it, it will prompt all over again... So I was
wondering what would be the keyring manager for i3...


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other packages I installed including SLIM as the display manager,
</I>&gt;<i> mrxvt &amp; urxvt as terminal emulators, Iceweasel (the &quot;Firefox&quot; on
</I>&gt;<i> Debian) &amp; chromium as web browsers, and scim, the Chinese input
</I>&gt;<i> method. Ocassionally I would use Icedove (the &quot;Thunderbird&quot; on Debian)
</I>&gt;<i> and pidgin. Adding xscreensaver, these are almost the full list of X
</I>&gt;<i> applications on my system now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This I am particularly interested, because I need to write Japanese,
Portuguese and Chinese on my machine. I am currently using ibus, which is
the default from Ubuntu, and it works in i3 as well, so I did not bother
looking for better approaches. Is SLIM better?

Thanks again!

BRUNO
