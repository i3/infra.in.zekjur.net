<PRE>Hi,

There is no harm installing i3-wm beside your normal Ubuntu GNOME
desktop environment. You can choose the i3 session at GDM login
screen. And try out various applications, whatever it comes from.

My initial i3 experience was on a laptop installed Xubuntu, that is
Ubuntu with Xfce desktop environment, because I was heard that Ubuntu
may have a wider support of different hardwares. Switching to a tiling
window manager was very pleasant. Later I got a desktop computer to
work with, and I installed Debian.

For Debian, you can only install a base system, and reboot to your new
system, then choose exactly those packages you need. Xorg + i3 will
suffice, no GNOME, no KDE. But I installed &quot;Thunar&quot;, the GUI file
manager from Xfce, which can help me automatically mount a USB stick
when it's plugged in.

The point is you choose the appropriate application to your liking,
e.g., wicd-curses or nm-applet to manage your network, or just use
static network setup like I'm doing in my Debian system; and I like to
use alsamixer to control the volumes in the terminal, but obviously
there are a lot of different applets to achieve this same task.

The other packages I installed including SLIM as the display manager,
mrxvt &amp; urxvt as terminal emulators, Iceweasel (the &quot;Firefox&quot; on
Debian) &amp; chromium as web browsers, and scim, the Chinese input
method. Ocassionally I would use Icedove (the &quot;Thunderbird&quot; on Debian)
and pidgin. Adding xscreensaver, these are almost the full list of X
applications on my system now.

Regards,
Xia
