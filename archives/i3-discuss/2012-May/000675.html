<PRE>  On my never ending journey to find the optimal tiling WM I am 
currently fiddling with i3 and til reallynow I like it.

All is working fine, it is very configurable and easy to do that, thanks 
for the great work.
The only problem I have is that I can't switch to named workspaces that 
begin with a number, like described in the manual.
For example, I want to auto-start Firefox and also want it to launch 
every time on the workspace named 1: Web, which is easily done with 
these lines in the configuration file:

exec firefox
assign [class = &quot;Firefox&quot;] 1: Web

There is no problem with that. The problem is that I can't switch to 
workspaces named like that using the keyboard.
I tried all of the following lines in my configuration file, but none 
worked:

bindsym Mod4+1 workspace 1
bindsym Mod4+1 workspace 1: Web
bindsym Mod4+1 workspace &quot;1: Web&quot;
bindsym Mod4+1 workspace number 1

Has anyone a clue what I am doing wrong? I simply can't figure it out.
</PRE>
