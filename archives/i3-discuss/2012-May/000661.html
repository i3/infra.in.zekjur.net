<PRE>Hi Elliott,

Thanks a lot for you thorough insight! Specially the dotfiles are being
very helpful to understand things I can do in the i3 config (which is not
exactly documented in the site).

I've been using i3 for a couple of months now, and I can say that it will
be hard to like anything else ever again... I always had at my disposal
large monitor space, so basically rearranging windows were my biggest pain.

I did before some mapping myself with xmodmap, but since I installed the
new Ubuntu and it just worked, I thought that I was kind of reinventing the
wheel... but I see, from your experience that it is all about being in
control of your machine. I get that... I think I will go in same direction.

Arch has always caught my attention here because in most of my problems I
end up reaching a blog of arch users, where I finally find my answer, so
good advice as well. I think I just got too used to the aptitude and debian
packages... I was thinking about going to debian, but since you've said it,
I will take a more careful look into it. Thanks.

The alt key was also one of the things that bothered me at first, specially
because I am so used to use the alt key for other stuff, like for browser
shortcuts.

The Gimp for me was a bad experience, even with the floating windows and
all, but the most recent updates that remove the floating menus, are a
salvation for me in i3 environment... libre-office, however, leaves some of
them out unless I dock them all, a bit weird... since I don't use that very
often, I can survive as it is.

Thanks again for your inputs. It was pretty helpful!

Cheers,

--

&gt;<i> Hey Bruno -- I'm not a guru, but I'll share my story since I'm just a
</I>&gt;<i> little ways ahead of you. And I've been wanting to pipe up and shower
</I>&gt;<i> Michael et al with gratitude and praise for what so far looks like the
</I>&gt;<i> biggest workflow improvement I've found in years. THANK YOU!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Start by blowing away a toy machine and experiment there. Or I
</I>&gt;<i> suppose you could be careful and just try to set up as a different
</I>&gt;<i> user on your main machine. My i3/GNOME integration attempt didn't go
</I>&gt;<i> well (but maybe it's commonly done). I'm enjoying having left GNOME
</I>&gt;<i> behind now anyway. So i3/X is all that's needed!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Find someone's dotfiles online who's doing something similar. You
</I>&gt;<i> probably just need .xinitrc and .i3/config, (and maybe .i3status) for
</I>&gt;<i> starters. Mine have the bulk of the config (nm-applet, udiskie, font
</I>&gt;<i> setting) in .i3/config
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://github.com/MicahElliott/dotfiles/blob/master/.i3/config">https://github.com/MicahElliott/dotfiles/blob/master/.i3/config</A>) as I
</I>&gt;<i> found some things didn't take by just putting into .xinitrc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * You can bind keys easily enough with xev, and xmodmap. I used to use
</I>&gt;<i> a crazy xkeycaps (IIRC) generated xmodmap to map keys all over the
</I>&gt;<i> place, but all you need is probably a few lines like in your .xinitrc:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/MicahElliott/dotfiles/blob/master/.xinitrc">https://github.com/MicahElliott/dotfiles/blob/master/.xinitrc</A> . All
</I>&gt;<i> you absolutely need in it is: exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch i3 .
</I>&gt;<i> But I've also manually mapped volume controls and pm-suspend. I also
</I>&gt;<i> call keychain just before firing i3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Ease into the User's Guide <A HREF="http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html,">http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html,</A> the
</I>&gt;<i> one and only doc you really need. So nice. Work to memorize the
</I>&gt;<i> bindings quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Get familiarized with the non-GNOME tool set:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Common_Applications#Image_Viewers">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Common_Applications#Image_Viewers</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Use lxappearance to change fonts (and theme if you like)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Rely on mod+r to quickly change things to your i3 config.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Decide a multi-monitor solution. i3 &quot;just works&quot; with zero config,
</I>&gt;<i> but it's a little different. GNOME spreads a desktop across all
</I>&gt;<i> monitors, but i3 treats each monitor as separate. I still haven't
</I>&gt;<i> fully adjusted but have mapped even-numbered desktops to my top
</I>&gt;<i> monitor and odds to laptop screen. This way I can hit ctrl-1-2 and
</I>&gt;<i> later ctrl-3-4 to emulate the GNOME way. I'm mixing it up too, but
</I>&gt;<i> still organize windows this way to large extent. I've bound mod+tab to
</I>&gt;<i> quckly bounce from one desktop &quot;back_and_forth&quot; to the next. You can
</I>&gt;<i> use arandr to config monitor settings and then export to a one-line
</I>&gt;<i> xrandr script. I have 3 setups in ~/bin and can quickly change screens
</I>&gt;<i> with ~/bin/xr1 (or xr2 or xr3).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Consider switching to Arch: rolling releases for bleeding edge of
</I>&gt;<i> anything, easy to make your own packages, lots of light-weight package
</I>&gt;<i> managers to choose from, have more control over what's on your
</I>&gt;<i> machine, extensive and well curated wiki and forums, and seems to be a
</I>&gt;<i> nice i3 cohort there. ArchBang was a decent install experience to get
</I>&gt;<i> graphics, network, etc working OOTB (my head looked like yours after
</I>&gt;<i> doing a vanilla Arch install :). And I stupidly let the installer
</I>&gt;<i> choose my root partition at a small size and later tried to load big
</I>&gt;<i> databases. So I'd recommend making / plenty big or just keeping /home
</I>&gt;<i> on the same partition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I couldn't give up my Alt key (not even close!), so mapped mod to
</I>&gt;<i> Win key. (Right-Alt is my tilde/backtick, so esc is more reachable.)
</I>&gt;<i> I'm mostly used to reaching for Win (Mod4) now, but I suppose
</I>&gt;<i> conquering alt/win/ctrl/shift combos for everything is like mastering
</I>&gt;<i> an instrument. I don't use arrow keys for anything (except stupid
</I>&gt;<i> browsers and spreadsheets). And as a vim user I was COMPLETELY
</I>&gt;<i> befuddled by the default jkl; mapping. i3 made it so easy to switch
</I>&gt;<i> these things (how commonly do people change it to vim's hjkl?). And
</I>&gt;<i> since I had to lose mod+h to the vim shift, I mapped mod+g to
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal, which makes some sense being near the vertical v.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * I use gimp often and i3's floating windows are working just fine for
</I>&gt;<i> me. Get used to holding mod and using both mouse keys for quickly
</I>&gt;<i> moving and resizing. Even non-floating windows benefit from
</I>&gt;<i> mod+right-mouse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Superfluous background....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd been using Ubuntu/GNOME for the last ~5 yrs, and using 10.04 LTS
</I>&gt;<i> since its release. I'd done a lot of tweaking to the point that things
</I>&gt;<i> were just getting too brittle (and stale). I figured I'd have to make
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of changes to get going with Unity and now was as good a time as
</I>&gt;<i> ever to simplify and reorganize. I decided to do the big-bang approach
</I>&gt;<i> and change OS and WM all in one go. This has turned into a major time
</I>&gt;<i> sink the last couple weeks but looking like it'll be worth it for
</I>&gt;<i> another 5+ yrs of happiness (quite possibly on this same machine!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I started with xmonad and got it working pretty well on another Arch
</I>&gt;<i> machine. Didn't even mind Haskell. Then put it on main system and hit
</I>&gt;<i> a Haskell packaging problem, bloated my machine with ghc, got into a
</I>&gt;<i> mess. And, was copying long recipes for xmonad/xmobar configs instead
</I>&gt;<i> of doing simple things that i3 supports. Also had tried awesomewm and
</I>&gt;<i> hit some bugs/surprises.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to the simplicity and minimalism of i3 (and Arch) I can finally
</I>&gt;<i> keep in my head where almost all my configs are and how to change
</I>&gt;<i> things (well, my vim config is still a bit messy). I'm now on a small
</I>&gt;<i> (and fast!) SSD and still have plenty of space. I can get new packages
</I>&gt;<i> every day and all the tools I'm using are brand new. I love the tiny
</I>&gt;<i> i3status and I've gone with the 1pixel window border that is working
</I>&gt;<i> so nicely (mod+b is mapped to cycle *b*order modes; I like titles on
</I>&gt;<i> some things like browsers). I've finally utilized every pixel, have
</I>&gt;<i> custom tiny fonts on everything, and have reached WM nirvana. I could
</I>&gt;<i> never get to this point of beautiful simplicity with GNOME.
