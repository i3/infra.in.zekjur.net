<PRE>Hi i3 gurus,

I am not sure if this question has popped up here before (if so,
apologies). I have migrated from usual Ubuntu (Gnome/Unity) environment to
i3-wm, and I am still facing some small issues... I mean, I want to get rid
of the Gnome stuff and run a cleaner i3 environment.

I guess my question is: how do you use the i3? I guess the i3 is not a
complete X environment (as the name says it all: window manager), so which
desktop environment should be the best to integrate with it? A simple Xorg?
or Xfce? I am sure you guys don't use Gnome (lol)...

Right now, I am still reluctant to do everything by hand (like configuring
wifi network, setting up bluetooth, etc), so I prefer to use the
applications available out there. For network management, I am using wicd,
and liking it a lot.

I think this is too broad question, but I was hoping I could get some
insights on best ways to use the i3, without too much hassle of doing it
all manually...

For example, I am relying on gnome-settings-daemon (this one fixes
keybindings for my mac, such as brightness and volume control, as well as
terminal font, etc) and gnome-keyring-daemon (controls the password
management for applications, specially used by network managers)... and I
don't know how to get rid of them, if I want to (doing all the key mapping
by myself is doable, but too much trouble, if there are packages out there
solving this for me already).

I would like to know how, in your experience, you get to solve such
problems to run a i3 environment smoothly...

Thanks!
