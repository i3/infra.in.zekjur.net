<PRE>Hey Bruno -- I'm not a guru, but I'll share my story since I'm just a
little ways ahead of you. And I've been wanting to pipe up and shower
Michael et al with gratitude and praise for what so far looks like the
biggest workflow improvement I've found in years. THANK YOU!!

My suggestions:

* Start by blowing away a toy machine and experiment there. Or I
suppose you could be careful and just try to set up as a different
user on your main machine. My i3/GNOME integration attempt didn't go
well (but maybe it's commonly done). I'm enjoying having left GNOME
behind now anyway. So i3/X is all that's needed!

* Find someone's dotfiles online who's doing something similar. You
probably just need .xinitrc and .i3/config, (and maybe .i3status) for
starters. Mine have the bulk of the config (nm-applet, udiskie, font
setting) in .i3/config
(<A HREF="https://github.com/MicahElliott/dotfiles/blob/master/.i3/config">https://github.com/MicahElliott/dotfiles/blob/master/.i3/config</A>) as I
found some things didn't take by just putting into .xinitrc.

* You can bind keys easily enough with xev, and xmodmap. I used to use
a crazy xkeycaps (IIRC) generated xmodmap to map keys all over the
place, but all you need is probably a few lines like in your .xinitrc:
<A HREF="https://github.com/MicahElliott/dotfiles/blob/master/.xinitrc">https://github.com/MicahElliott/dotfiles/blob/master/.xinitrc</A> . All
you absolutely need in it is: exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch i3 .
But I've also manually mapped volume controls and pm-suspend. I also
call keychain just before firing i3.

* Ease into the User's Guide <A HREF="http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html,">http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html,</A> the
one and only doc you really need. So nice. Work to memorize the
bindings quickly.

* Get familiarized with the non-GNOME tool set:
<A HREF="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Common_Applications#Image_Viewers">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Common_Applications#Image_Viewers</A>

* Use lxappearance to change fonts (and theme if you like)

* Rely on mod+r to quickly change things to your i3 config.

* Decide a multi-monitor solution. i3 &quot;just works&quot; with zero config,
but it's a little different. GNOME spreads a desktop across all
monitors, but i3 treats each monitor as separate. I still haven't
fully adjusted but have mapped even-numbered desktops to my top
monitor and odds to laptop screen. This way I can hit ctrl-1-2 and
later ctrl-3-4 to emulate the GNOME way. I'm mixing it up too, but
still organize windows this way to large extent. I've bound mod+tab to
quckly bounce from one desktop &quot;back_and_forth&quot; to the next. You can
use arandr to config monitor settings and then export to a one-line
xrandr script. I have 3 setups in ~/bin and can quickly change screens
with ~/bin/xr1 (or xr2 or xr3).

* Consider switching to Arch: rolling releases for bleeding edge of
anything, easy to make your own packages, lots of light-weight package
managers to choose from, have more control over what's on your
machine, extensive and well curated wiki and forums, and seems to be a
nice i3 cohort there. ArchBang was a decent install experience to get
graphics, network, etc working OOTB (my head looked like yours after
doing a vanilla Arch install :). And I stupidly let the installer
choose my root partition at a small size and later tried to load big
databases. So I'd recommend making / plenty big or just keeping /home
on the same partition.

* I couldn't give up my Alt key (not even close!), so mapped mod to
Win key. (Right-Alt is my tilde/backtick, so esc is more reachable.)
I'm mostly used to reaching for Win (Mod4) now, but I suppose
conquering alt/win/ctrl/shift combos for everything is like mastering
an instrument. I don't use arrow keys for anything (except stupid
browsers and spreadsheets). And as a vim user I was COMPLETELY
befuddled by the default jkl; mapping. i3 made it so easy to switch
these things (how commonly do people change it to vim's hjkl?). And
since I had to lose mod+h to the vim shift, I mapped mod+g to
horizontal, which makes some sense being near the vertical v.

* I use gimp often and i3's floating windows are working just fine for
me. Get used to holding mod and using both mouse keys for quickly
moving and resizing. Even non-floating windows benefit from
mod+right-mouse.

Superfluous background....

I'd been using Ubuntu/GNOME for the last ~5 yrs, and using 10.04 LTS
since its release. I'd done a lot of tweaking to the point that things
were just getting too brittle (and stale). I figured I'd have to make
a lot of changes to get going with Unity and now was as good a time as
ever to simplify and reorganize. I decided to do the big-bang approach
and change OS and WM all in one go. This has turned into a major time
sink the last couple weeks but looking like it'll be worth it for
another 5+ yrs of happiness (quite possibly on this same machine!).

I started with xmonad and got it working pretty well on another Arch
machine. Didn't even mind Haskell. Then put it on main system and hit
a Haskell packaging problem, bloated my machine with ghc, got into a
mess. And, was copying long recipes for xmonad/xmobar configs instead
of doing simple things that i3 supports. Also had tried awesomewm and
hit some bugs/surprises.

Thanks to the simplicity and minimalism of i3 (and Arch) I can finally
keep in my head where almost all my configs are and how to change
things (well, my vim config is still a bit messy). I'm now on a small
(and fast!) SSD and still have plenty of space. I can get new packages
every day and all the tools I'm using are brand new. I love the tiny
i3status and I've gone with the 1pixel window border that is working
so nicely (mod+b is mapped to cycle *b*order modes; I like titles on
some things like browsers). I've finally utilized every pixel, have
custom tiny fonts on everything, and have reached WM nirvana. I could
never get to this point of beautiful simplicity with GNOME.
