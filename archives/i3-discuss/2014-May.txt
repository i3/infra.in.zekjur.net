Subject: [i3] Title bar on bottom of window
Message-ID: <20140503170442.GB23863@katrina>

Hi there,

I am wondering (as a feature request) about an option to have the
title bar of a window at the bottom of the window, instead of as the
top.

If this isn't suitable for being included in i3, I was wondering about
patching it for my own copy. I have looked in the x_draw_decoration
function in src/x.c, but I'm not sure how to proceed. In particular,
I'm not sure how to get the correct dimensions to draw the bar when
initialising the xcb_rectangle_t---currently it looks like this:
  xcb_rectangle_t drect = { con->deco_rect.x, con->deco_rect.y,
    con->deco_rect.width, con->deco_rect.height };
  cb_poly_fill_rectangle(conn, parent->pixmap, parent->pm_gc, 1, &drect);

In case you're wondering why I want to do such a strange thing...I
like to set the title of my xterm to contain ephemeral information,
such as hostname, git status, and various other things. I dislike long
and complicated prompts, so I put this information in the title
instead. But, the title is at the top of the screen, whereas the
prompt of my xterm is at the bottom. I'd like to have the title bar
just underneath my prompt, i.e. at the bottom of the window.

cheers

Subject: [i3] "Hamburger-menu" in Firefox 29 is not displayed
Message-ID: <87oazdlvwi.fsf@gmail.com>

Hello,

I recently upgraded my Firefox to version 29 and noticed that clicking
on the icon in the top-right corner does not show me the menu it is
supposed to.  Upon clicking I can see something flickering _very_
shortly in the place where the menu should appear.

Is this something that happens to other people too? Or is this something
related to my configuration only? As this is quite a normal i3 setup I figured
this might be a bug.

i3 version 4.7.2 (2014-01-23, branch "tags/4.7.2")

If you need more information, please don't hesitate to ask.

Regards,

There seems to be something wrong with the theme I am using. Switching
to the default theme fixes the problem. I don't know anything about
firefox theming, but maybe this issue on the theme's github repo might
be related:

I wonder if this wouldn't be more straightforward to launch your
terminals with a properly configured tmux/screen ? I don't use those 2
softwares but I think they allow to do something along the lines you
want.

Thanks for this idea. I spent about half a day messing around with
tmux, and I am able to get a status line at the bottom of my terminal.
However I am not going to continue using it, for the following
reasons:

- It makes terminal drawing slow. This is especially bad for e.g.
  navigating though a LaTeX document in vim with syntax highlighting.
- I like the fact that the active window's top bar can be a different
  colour to other windows in i3 :) of course with tmux, all the status
  bars must remain the same color.

I would rather have a top bar natively in i3, than a bottom bar with
tmux. But thanks! I learned many things while playing with tmux :)

Subject: [i3] Content Assistant
Message-ID: <CABTqaieBFMBjBsASg7nLXFy9EX6ey1Q2xJs615-0G7ZGuC=qTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi -

I recently switch to i3 from the standard Ubuntu 14.04  environment and I'm
really liking the tile environment.

While using i3 I noticed that the eclipse content assistant is not
functioning very well, for example it is unable to auto complete classe
name when i push ctrl+space.  For example under the standard desktop
environment it would complete things like 'ArrayList' when I type 'Array
Ctrl+space' but under i3 nothing happens, the content assistant wont be
pop-up.

Oddly enough it the content assistant works fine when searching for methods
on already defined objects.

Has anyone also found this and does anyone have a solution ??

Thanks in advance.

...Chris

Hi,

just checked and I cannot confirm that behaviour. I have eclipse version
3.8.1 and i3 version 4.7.2 running and the autocompletion works as expected.

Could you just double-check you don't have Ctrl+Space bound to something
in i3?

Note that dunst comes with Ctrl+Space as default keybinding.

What’s always worth a shot is trying to reproduce problems with a fresh
user account to rule out local setup issues.

Message-ID: <5376A8C3.4030600@arcor.de>

Dear i3 community,

there's a new feature in j4-make-config available. It enables you to 
easily switch between themes for i3. But now it also enables you to 
easily put together a complete i3 config from several different 
configuration parts, depending on the environment you are currently 
working in.

So you can do things like:

- have different layouts and font sizes for different screen sizes
- have one i3bar section for your laptop and two i3bar sections for your 
dual monitor setup at home
- have different keybindings depending on the keyboard you are using
- and much more - any i3 configuration option can be used!

Go check it out at: https://github.com/okraits/j4-make-config

Please feel free to send me feedback and contributions
regarding bugreports, feature requests, improvements,
themes, etc. via mail at okraits at arcor.de. You can also
contact me on irc.twice-irc.de in #i3 and #j4tools.

I'm looking forward to your feedback.

Greetings,

Oliver

Your general approach seems correct.

The placeholder containers tell you which criteria they look for, and if
the new window does not match these criteria, it will not be swallowed
by the placeholder container.

In case manual introspection (i.e. comparing the xprop output for the
affected window with the placeholder contents) is not enough, I suggest
you check the logfile to see what i3 does:
http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html

If you still cannot figure it out, feel free to follow up, but with a
maximum debug level logfile please (compress it first before you send
it).

Thanks.

Thank you, Michael.

I found the reason for it not working properly. I didn't specify a 
correct 'title' variable in the json file:

  "swallows": [
                {
                 "class": "^XTerm$",
                 "instance": "^bottomleft$",
                 "title": "^mc$"
                }

Previously, both the 'instance' and 'title' variable were assigned the 
value 'bottomleft'.

For the benefit of other people reading it: the above container will 
swallow an instance of xterm running mc.

xterm -name bottomleft -e 'mc'


On a separate note, is it possible to run an i3-msg command from a 
script (as opposed to via dmenu) or bind it to a key?
It does not seem to be working for me:

bindsym XF86Favorites exec /usr/bin/i3-msg 'workspace 1; append_layout 
/home/sycamorex/ws_1-generic.json'

It does not append the layout.

I also have a script containing just one line:

i3-msg 'workspace 1; append_layout /home/sycamorex/.i3/ws_1-generic.json'

When I run it from a terminal, the only thing that happens is the output:

[{"success":true}]

Thank you for your help.

regards
Marcin

That's all you gonna get from i3-msg. It means your request succeeded,
so it should have worked.

Thank you, Michael.

I found the reason for it not working properly. I didn't specify a 
correct 'title' variable in the json file:

"swallows": [
{
"class": "^XTerm$",
"instance": "^bottomleft$",
"title": "^mc$"
}

Previously, both the 'instance' and 'title' variable were assigned the 
value 'bottomleft'.

For the benefit of other people reading it: the above container will 
swallow an instance of xterm running mc.

xterm -name bottomleft -e 'mc'


On a separate note, is it possible to run an i3-msg command from a 
script (as opposed to via dmenu) or bind it to a key?
It does not seem to be working for me:

bindsym XF86Favorites exec /usr/bin/i3-msg 'workspace 1; append_layout 
/home/sycamorex/ws_1-generic.json'

It does not append the layout.

I also have a script containing just one line:

i3-msg 'workspace 1; append_layout /home/sycamorex/.i3/ws_1-generic.json'

When I run it from a terminal, the only thing that happens is the output:

[{"success":true}]

Thank you for your help.

Subject: [i3] segfaults with libxcb-1.10
Message-ID: <m2bnuvsdsx.fsf@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>

I am using i3 on OS X 10.9.3 as the window manager under XQuartz.

Newest XQuartz 2.7.6 updated (amongst many other parts) libxcb to
version 1.10 (previous versions came with libxcb-1.9.1).  With
libxcb-1.10, i3 (latest release, master, and next) segfaults during
startup in libxcb:

Thread 0 Crashed:: Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread

Has anybody else seen this problem with libxcb-1.10 on OS X or other
platforms?  Is this most likely caused by XQuartz, libxcb, libsn, or i3?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <537B0991.5000606@cookiesoft.de>

Hello everyone,

I currently use Conky for some system information and it works (wow,
didn't expect it).
But I'd like to have a weather forecast, too, but I don't think, that I
can use the apps from KDE/Gnome, can I?
So what's the best solution, *without* using conky.

Greetings,
Marcel

There are a handful replacements for i3status like i3pystatus or
py3status. I don't know about py3status ; i3pystatus has a weather
module built in.

I am facing the same issue. Eclipse is not auto completing when I press 
ctrl+space in i3. I am using eclipse 4.3 and i3 4.7.2 on Ubuntu 14.04. Just 
to make sure my .i3/config is not binding any keys, I completely deleted the 
file and created an empty config file. Yet I am unable to get the eclipse 
code completion to work with ctrl+space. Any other ideas?

Hi

I absolutely love i3, I've been switching window managers fairly
regularly for.. 10+ years, but i3 I'm really enjoying.

My only annoyance is with the google chrome hangouts extension and my laptop.

Question 1:
I regularly use multiple different screens (with different
resolutions), I'd love to use for_window to lock the hangouts window
to the lower right corner of my screen, but I can't really do this by
px, as the resolutions will constantly change. Can I specify move
position up 20px, left 20px, with the lower right corner as gravity
somehow?

Question 2:
Often when clicking on the extension (or a person in the chat) I'll
have a window open with that content on another workspace. In those
cases chrome will request that window gets focus, but since it's on
another workspace I won't see that. Is there any option to either
switch me to the workspace/move the window to the current workspace
when a window requests focus? (.. and I do realize this option could
be absolutely horrid if some random window has bad behavior and
requests focus constantly.. :/ )

Best regards
Anders

Nope. You’ll need a custom script for that using the IPC interface, see
http://build.i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html

We intentionally disallow these kinds of focus requests for exactly the
reason you cite in your last sentence. src/handlers.c:728 is the place
in the code if you want to patch it yourself and see what happens in
your setup.

Very nice, I've looked over the documentation several times without
noticing there was a ipc interface.

I'l definitely check out that out. Do you think it would be worth it
to add a IPC event for a denied focus request? I can have a go at
making a pull request for it if you'd be interested, but it might be a
bit of a corner case..

That sounds reasonable. That way, a third-party script can make the
decision (based on arbitrarily complex rules) on what to focus. Submit
patches at http://cr.i3wm.org/ :).

Since nobody seems to have run into this problem, I started digging
deeper.  The problem was caused by my setup, I realized that I was
linking against libsn that itself was linking against a rather old
libxcb-1.6.  Rebuilding libsn and linking it against libxcb-1.10 fixed
the problem.  Sorry for the noise.

Sent a patch to http://cr.i3wm.org/patch/559 now. I unfortunately
can't get the tests running. Trying to start up a x session with
Xdummy seems to make the nvidia driver explode... I've done some
manual testing and I really don't see how this could screw up anything
else (.. famous last words I know).

It's been a good 5 years since I've written any C or perl, so any
comments are welcome :)

I can do testing in a VM if needed, but I won't have time for that
tonight. If I make some slightly larger pull requests I will set that
up though.

Starting to implement the client side of this I realize it might be
good to know the workspace of the window in question. That's easy
enough to add.  Also technically we could skip the "changed" field, as
the "focused" field in the container will tell you the same
information. I also wouldn't mind knowing the window class. Any
technical reason that's not already in the Con class?
