<PRE>Hi. I didn't want to polute the bug report.

&gt;<i> Of course, this behavior should only be triggered when the
</I>&gt;<i>  scratchpad is empty.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You mean because this way you cannot have more then one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scratchpad window opened at the same time?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>
&gt;<i>From the description of the scratchpad and the way I'm using it my reasoning
</I>for this is following.
Since I cannot open more then one scratchpad window on a workspace, for having
more then one scratchpad window opened I need to move it around so I can treat
such windows as normal windows on the workspaces. The scratchpad for me is
simply a placeholder for stuff that runs in the background that I use for a
quick onetime task and put back again, such as a media player, IM etc. If I
need it for something permanent I simply include it in the workspace and when
I'm done I put it back. The way it is now it doesn't really make it simpler to
have more of those windows opened and still have it like a scratch pad.

If it is a viable way there could be a switch that would allow to configure i3
to act either in the current way or in the proposed so it doesn't force
everybody to confirm to the same way this feature is used. 
I would think this should only require modification of how the window that is
brought to the front gets selected so it might not be much of an invasion to
the current code but I can be mistaken.

Martin
