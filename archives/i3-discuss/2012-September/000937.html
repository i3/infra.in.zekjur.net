<PRE>Hi Oliver,

Oliver Kiddle &lt;<A HREF="http://infra.in.zekjur.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/i3-discuss">okiddle at yahoo.co.uk</A>&gt; writes:
&gt;<i> It seems cairo has been built without xcb support or at least
</I>&gt;<i> cairo/cairo-xcb.h was not found. I worked around this by disabling pango
</I>&gt;<i> which is easy enough. My Debian system has a cairo-xcb.pc file so it
</I>&gt;<i> should be possible to make that automatic if it is the most appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> workaround.
</I>No, we will NOT make this automatic. Pango support is an important
feature of i3 and if you decide to rip it out, you should really do that
in a concious way.

&gt;<i> The next problem was with ev.h not being found when compiling i3-msg,
</I>&gt;<i> i3-nagbar, i3-config-wizard and i3-input. $(LIBEV_CFLAGS) was missing
</I>&gt;<i> from their Makefiles and ev.h is in /usr/include/libev (it presumably
</I>&gt;<i> works by accident on Debian because there it is just /usr/include/ev.h).
</I>&gt;<i> However, it looks to me like these #includes are superfluous and the
</I>&gt;<i> correct fix is simply to remove them as per the patch below.
</I>Thanks, I&#8217;ve merged this patch.

&gt;<i> Finally, the trickiest problem is that yajl_get_bytes_consumed() was
</I>&gt;<i> introduced with yajl 1.0.8 and RHEL 6 includes yajl 1.0.7. The relevant
</I>&gt;<i> call was introduced in commit e53405c2 and it seemed fairly safe to
</I>&gt;<i> apply that whole change in reverse.
</I>Note that this change is important for third-party scripts. Removing it
is only fine as long as you don&#8217;t share that package. If you intend to
package an RPM and distribute it, please find a different solution, for
example statically linking yajl 1.0.8 (also, I hate how yajl &lt;2 didn&#8217;t
bring a pkg-config file, so we can&#8217;t automatically check for the
presence of this function).

Michael
