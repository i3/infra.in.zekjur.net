<PRE>Hi,

DR &lt;<A HREF="http://infra.in.zekjur.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/i3-discuss">drdarkraven at gmail.com</A>&gt; writes:
&gt;<i> I'm quite new on linux, and BitKeeper is long gone before I even heard of
</I>&gt;<i> linux, so I could be wrong on this. But for what I understand, it's
</I>&gt;<i> religious people like RMS who forced linux and BitKeeper to part ways, not
</I>&gt;<i> BitKeeper's being proprietary limited the development of kernel.
</I>No, I think you got that wrong:

&gt;<i> Imagine I switched to linux distributions from Windows, and change it to
</I>&gt;<i> look&amp;behave exactly the same as Windows, then why would I make the change?
</I>&gt;<i> If you not really have a better idea, why not just use the existing
</I>&gt;<i> solution, even if it's closed?
</I>I will not go into this discussion. I think I made my point clear
enough in my previous mail.

&gt;<i> I don't know you, maybe you have a definitely better idea of how a code
</I>&gt;<i> reviewing system should be than GitHub. But if not, why not using
</I>&gt;<i> GitHub
</I>I don&#8217;t, GitHub&#8217;s review workflow is pretty good.

&gt;<i> This could be a problem. But GitHub is not dedicated to i3, so people who
</I>&gt;<i> want to contribute might &quot;happens&quot; to have a GitHub account.
</I>And people who wight mant to contribute to i3 might be very opposed to
getting a GitHub account.

&gt;<i> My perception of &quot;distribution&quot; is a bit different as yours. I think being
</I>&gt;<i> distributed means every one who clone the repo have complete history of the
</I>&gt;<i> repo. So have one *more* clone on GitHub won't harm this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> distribution at all.
</I>I already mentioned that having an inferior clone on github sucks, and
caring about an up-to-date clone sucks even more.

&gt;<i> There are no two copies of one repo, there are two different branches which
</I>&gt;<i> could pull from each other. I think out-of-sync would be too big a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> And the network problem is a matter of view point. GitHub might be slow for
</I>&gt;<i> you, but faster for someone else, and your server might be fast for you,
</I>&gt;<i> but slow for someone else.
</I>Yes, but since I push all changes to i3, it matters if it&#8217;s fast for
me, not for anyone else.

Best regards,
Michael
