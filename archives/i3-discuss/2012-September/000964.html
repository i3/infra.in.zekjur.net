<PRE>Hi darkraven,

</I>No. GitHub (while being a cool company with a good product) is
proprietary. I cannot host their review software on my own
server, thus using GitHub for code reviews is a vendor lock-in.

I want to avoid such a vendor lock-in for several reasons:

1) Building free software should not depend on closed-source
   software. I&#8217;m not saying this in a _very_ religios fashion such as
   rms (who&#8217;d argue that my server&#8217;s BIOS is probably unfree), but it
   seems reasonable to avoid closed-source if we can reasonably live
   without it. We&#8217;ve seen what happened with BitKeeper and the Linux
   kernel.

2) If we want to improve the code review workflow in some detail, we
   cannot do it. Unless GitHub is friendly enough to do it, if it makes
   sense for them at all. This is the major reason why I switched to a
   FOSS operating system and software. Similarly, they have the option
   of modifying the software as they see fit, without asking us first
   and without an alternative for us.

3) GitHub requires an account to submit a pull request. This is
   reasonable from GitHub&#8217;s point of view but unacceptable from ours. No
   account creation barriers to reporting bugs and sending improvements
   has been one of our principles since the very beginning of the
   project.

4) With using GitHub for reviews, we effectively have to use GitHub for
   our git repository. Otherwise we&#8217;d have to mirror it, but having two
   copies which might be out of sync is stupid, so we&#8217;d have to push to
   both locations. GitHub (in my daily life) is slow. And sometimes it&#8217;s
   down. My own server is much more reliable for our little
   project. Also, it seems wise to avoid a central point-of-failure and
   encourage a distributed system (many git servers instead of every
   FOSS project on GitHub).

Best regards,
Michael
