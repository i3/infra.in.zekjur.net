<PRE>Hi Michael,

&gt;<i> Hi darkraven,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've read your criteria at <A HREF="http://www.featurequest.org/FRQ$CodeReview.">http://www.featurequest.org/FRQ$CodeReview.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> From
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what I've read I think GitHub is good enough for you.
</I>&gt;<i> No. GitHub (while being a cool company with a good product) is
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary. I cannot host their review software on my own
</I>&gt;<i> server, thus using GitHub for code reviews is a vendor lock-in.
</I>
I won't try to persuade you to use GitHub, but I think some of your points
are quite arguable.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to avoid such a vendor lock-in for several reasons:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Building free software should not depend on closed-source
</I>&gt;<i>    software. I&#8217;m not saying this in a _very_ religios fashion such as
</I>&gt;<i>    rms (who&#8217;d argue that my server&#8217;s BIOS is probably unfree), but it
</I>&gt;<i>    seems reasonable to avoid closed-source if we can reasonably live
</I>&gt;<i>    without it. We&#8217;ve seen what happened with BitKeeper and the Linux
</I>&gt;<i>    kernel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm quite new on linux, and BitKeeper is long gone before I even heard of
linux, so I could be wrong on this. But for what I understand, it's
religious people like RMS who forced linux and BitKeeper to part ways, not
BitKeeper's being proprietary limited the development of kernel.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) If we want to improve the code review workflow in some detail, we
</I>&gt;<i>    cannot do it. Unless GitHub is friendly enough to do it, if it makes
</I>&gt;<i>    sense for them at all. This is the major reason why I switched to a
</I>&gt;<i>    FOSS operating system and software. Similarly, they have the option
</I>&gt;<i>    of modifying the software as they see fit, without asking us first
</I>&gt;<i>    and without an alternative for us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Imagine I switched to linux distributions from Windows, and change it to
look&amp;behave exactly the same as Windows, then why would I make the change?
If you not really have a better idea, why not just use the existing
solution, even if it's closed?
I don't know you, maybe you have a definitely better idea of how a code
reviewing system should be than GitHub. But if not, why not using GitHub
for now, and when you eventually feel the itch to make changes, you could
start making your own. And by that time, what you make will definitely  be
better.
Oops, this sounds like persuading. Anyway, I'm just using GitHub as an
example to make my point.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) GitHub requires an account to submit a pull request. This is
</I>&gt;<i>    reasonable from GitHub&#8217;s point of view but unacceptable from ours. No
</I>&gt;<i>    account creation barriers to reporting bugs and sending improvements
</I>&gt;<i>    has been one of our principles since the very beginning of the
</I>&gt;<i>    project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This could be a problem. But GitHub is not dedicated to i3, so people who
want to contribute might &quot;happens&quot; to have a GitHub account.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) With using GitHub for reviews, we effectively have to use GitHub for
</I>&gt;<i>    our git repository. Otherwise we&#8217;d have to mirror it, but having two
</I>&gt;<i>    copies which might be out of sync is stupid, so we&#8217;d have to push to
</I>&gt;<i>    both locations. GitHub (in my daily life) is slow. And sometimes it&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i>    down. My own server is much more reliable for our little
</I>&gt;<i>    project. Also, it seems wise to avoid a central point-of-failure and
</I>&gt;<i>    encourage a distributed system (many git servers instead of every
</I>&gt;<i>    FOSS project on GitHub).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>My perception of &quot;distribution&quot; is a bit different as yours. I think being
distributed means every one who clone the repo have complete history of the
repo. So have one *more* clone on GitHub won't harm this kind of
distribution at all.
There are no two copies of one repo, there are two different branches which
could pull from each other. I think out-of-sync would be too big a problem.
And the network problem is a matter of view point. GitHub might be slow for
you, but faster for someone else, and your server might be fast for you,
but slow for someone else.


&gt;<i> --
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If my points sound stupid, point that out and help cure my stupidity,
thanks!

&gt;<i>  Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Michael
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Best regards.
