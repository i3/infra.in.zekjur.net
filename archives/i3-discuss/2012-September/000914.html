<PRE>Hi all,

testing next for a few days. I noticed that for instance trying to resize 
a window which is alone on a workspace popups an error. Generally it
does any resizing in any invalid direction.

I've read the release notes. Basically i think it's a good idea to be
more responsive at runtime. But do we really want to be that strict?

I think it's annoying and the message shown in i3-nagbar is not much
helpful anyway. Maybe we can just work this out later and make it better
somehow.

Otherwise i can't complain about anything. Thanks to all of you for your 
great work i'm starting to be very pleased with i3.

Cheers,
Pavel
