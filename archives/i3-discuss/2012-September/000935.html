<PRE>I had a few issues building the latest i3.

It seems cairo has been built without xcb support or at least
cairo/cairo-xcb.h was not found. I worked around this by disabling pango
which is easy enough. My Debian system has a cairo-xcb.pc file so it
should be possible to make that automatic if it is the most appropriate
workaround.

The next problem was with ev.h not being found when compiling i3-msg,
i3-nagbar, i3-config-wizard and i3-input. $(LIBEV_CFLAGS) was missing
from their Makefiles and ev.h is in /usr/include/libev (it presumably
works by accident on Debian because there it is just /usr/include/ev.h).
However, it looks to me like these #includes are superfluous and the
correct fix is simply to remove them as per the patch below.

Finally, the trickiest problem is that yajl_get_bytes_consumed() was
introduced with yajl 1.0.8 and RHEL 6 includes yajl 1.0.7. The relevant
call was introduced in commit e53405c2 and it seemed fairly safe to
apply that whole change in reverse.
