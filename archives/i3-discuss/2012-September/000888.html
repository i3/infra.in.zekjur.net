<PRE>Hi darkraven,

Quoting DR (2012-08-20 17:52:16)
&gt;<i> This patch clean up some of the render.c logic, make way for implement
</I>&gt;<i> popup-while-fullscreen behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This patch hasn't been heavily tested. So maybe this patch would change the
</I>&gt;<i> rendering result under some circumstance.
</I>First of all, I apologize for taking so long to comment on this patch.
I want to clearly point out why reviewing your patches is really hard
for me and what you can do to improve the situation.

The patch which you posted has multiple issues:

1) The commit title is absolutely meaningless. &quot;make render_con logic
   more clearer&quot; is a subjective thing. While it&#8217;s okay as a title, you
   absolutely need to provide a description consisting of the individual
   changes you have done. It would be even better if the individual
   changes were individual commits, but I don&#8217;t pose that as a
   requirement.

   An example for a good description would be:
   &quot;Refactored identical code from render_x and render_y into new
   function render_xy_common(), no functional changes at all.&quot;

2) You introduce new unnecessary whitespace (first hunk,
   src/render.c:24).

3) You change our if (fullscreen) { &#8230;; return; } block to if
   (!fullscreen){ /* other stuff */ } &#8230;; without any obvious reason.
   Why? Returning early is good style and consistently used within i3.
   Also, we use blanks before brackets.

4) More importantly, you refactor two loops into one, but this breaks
   things! The first loop only cares for cons with -&gt;type ==
   CT_DOCKAREA, the second one handles all cons.

5) I can&#8217;t really figure out what the rest of your changes do. They seem
   to move code around, but it&#8217;s not clear based on the diff. You really
   should provide an explanation and/or split it up into multiple
   smaller commits.

I also want to point out that similar comments have been made multiple
times before in your threads:

<A HREF="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.i3.general/200">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.i3.general/200</A>
<A HREF="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.i3.general/343">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.i3.general/343</A>
<A HREF="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.i3.general/279">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.i3.general/279</A>

Why do you keep sending patches like these and don&#8217;t pay attention to
the things we point you to? This makes the whole reviewing and merging
workflow really hard :-/.

Best regards,
Michael
