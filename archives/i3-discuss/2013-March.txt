Subject: [i3] Introducing py3status
Message-ID: <5130CED7.50005@ultrabug.net>

Dear i3wm list,

I am pleased to announce a new user-contributed project named py3status.

http://i3wm.org/docs/user-contributed/py3status.html

py3status gives you an easy and flexible way to display your own stuff 
in your i3barby wrapping your current i3status configuration. You can 
read more details on the project's wiki.

https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/wiki

Feel free to propose or ask if you have some ideas of useful 
modules/plugins we could add to the project for everyone's usage, I'm 
open to suggestions.

I hope this little contribution will help some of us i3wm users to 
quickly and efficiently hack their i3bar:)

Subject: [i3] Failing tests on master and ticket #807.
Message-ID: <51342951.5020905@anue.biz>

Hi,

I've been studying the code-base and started working on ticket #807[0]. 
At the moment I have a working implementation and got acquainted with 
the basics for writing and running tests.

After running the test-suite, to see how much stuff I broke, I got 
several failures; so I reverted my changes, recompiled i3 and re-ran the 
suite just in case. Unfortunately I found out tests were also failing in 
the current master branch.

I'm attaching the complete-run.log in the hope it will help to fix the 
testcases.

BTW I updated the ticket with the patch, comments and suggestions are 
appreciated.

Please always work on the ?next? branch, master is bugfix-only. The
testsuite regularly gets improvements, which are only available in the
next branch.

Is this documented somewhere? If it's not, I think it's worth mentioning 
the development workflow in the hacking howto.

Done. But I also realized you closed #807 as invalid. I think it's worth 
to keep the bug open until some resolution is taken with regards to the 
provided patches.

Subject: [i3] Problem with i3 and mathematica
Message-ID: <51387908.5000704@andreasbuhr.de>

Hi there,

I do have a question about the usage of i3, maybe you can help me?

I am trying to use the software "Mathematica", but there are issues:
When opening the help/documentation, a window opens. This window seems 
to be floating. I can interact with this window using my mouse, but it 
seems to not receive keyboard events. Any keyboard event seem to arrive 
at another window, usually the one behind the mathematica help. Also the 
window is visible on all workspaces and I did not find a way to close it.

Others have reported this to Wolfram:
http://forums.wolfram.com/student-support/topics/109180

I have tried to un-float the window by mod-shift-space, but also this 
command was applied to the window *behind* the help-window.

Any ideas?
If I can help in fixing this problem in any

thanks a lot in advance,
Andreas

Hi Andreas,

There is a ticket for that:

http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/787

I have no further ideas on how to debug this, given that I don?t have
access to that software (or its source code, which would be helpful?).

Subject: [i3] Problem with i3 urgency hints
Message-ID: <CAK9rt1o655jWyQBZELBM9OaP8nyq29p5+7uHy6d=A6R0cKicQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I have some problems, configuring the urgency hint with i3.

I have configured the indicators in i3 and i3bar, added the urgency hints
in urxvt and in the bash prompt. Everything works fine, but the behaviour
is quiet strange. If I open another i3-sensible-terminal with the
configured key binding, some of the terminals which are already present on
the workspace get the urgency hint. It does not depend on how i open up the
terminal (with key binding, with command from one of the old terminals or
with dmenu, all the same).

I could figure out some sort of pattern. The hint goes up the layout tree,
but sometimes skips a node. For example if I open five terminals in a row,
the first 3 got the hint, but the 4 not (and the 5 of course not, because
its focused). It is quiet random, cause if I do the same thing on another
workspace again, it might be that all 4 "old" terminals got the hint.

Is the behaviour that the urgency hint goes up the tree as expected? How
can I prevent the hint from beeing populated to the parent if I have
focused the current window, like when I open a new terminal? Running i3
version 4.4-145-g8327f83 (2013-03-03, branch "next"). Same behaviour on
stable release.

Thanks, chris

The very same thing happened to me. After just running empty gpg it created few files and I repeated procedure without any errors. I am using Ubuntu repository for i3.

I can?t keep too many tickets open, it exceeds my mental capacity. We

Can you please file a ticket at http://bugs.i3wm.org/? What you

Subject: [i3] decent kde integration with i3?
Message-ID: <20130316191653.GA1274@anton>


Hello list members!

I've been running and enjoying i3 for a few months now and 
have been very pleased with it.  Prior to i3, I was using
a minimal kde session + kwin; and I find that I still want
to use some of the conveniences/features/apps I enjoyed in
kde.

So I managed to get kde to use i3wm as alternative to kwin
last night, however I'm running into issues - I'm hoping
someone here might have some suggestions or comments:

#1 - attempting to run krunner always crashes i3 (v. 4.5)

#2 - I can't see any of the system-tray items unless I
     run a plasma panel - I don't see how to get kde
     plasma tray items in the i3bar

#3 - I'm having a tough time figuring out how to properly
     exit kde when i3 is the wm: if I mod-alt-e to exit
     i3, then things hang in an F'd up state because i3
     exited, but kde is still lingering


Basically, I'd like to just use i3wm for its window-handling
and management, but I'd like to use as much of kde and 
kde-integration as possible.


So I guess I can list this another way - what I'd like to 
be able to do:

* access system-tray stuff either via a kde panel, or via
  i3bar/i3status.

* execute krunner without crashes, possibly use krunner
  in lieue of dmenu if possible.

* be able to properly exit/logout-of the kde session


Anyone else using i3 as an alternative to kwin in a mostly 
kde environment, primarily for i3's tiling window management 
features?


Thanks for any assistance, much appreciated! I did spend
quite a bit of time last night experimenting and hunting
google and forums for solutions, but to no avail.

Hi,

I'm running kde with i3 as window manager and it's working very well. I did
have to make a few changes to i3 to make them play nicely together, which
I'll describe below.

First of all to tell kde to use i3 instead of kwin I used the KDEWM
environment variable which is set inside the .kde/env/set_window_manager.sh
shell script.

Inside i3's config file I have added the following commands to prevent
various kde pop-ups from being decorated/tiled:

for_window [class="Plasma-desktop"] border none
for_window [class="krunner"] border none
for_window [class="Kmix"] floating enable;
for_window [class="Plasmoidviewer"] floating enable;
for_window [class="Klipper"] floating enable; border none

Lastly, I have a set of patches on top of the i3 next branch (they should
apply fine on top of 4.5 as well), which I'm attaching to this email. Not
all are needed for kde/i3 integration, I'm including all of them here
because I don't have time to check if they apply cleanly when some are
missing.

0001-Fix-crash-in-some-situations.patch
This should fix the krunner crash.

0002-Added-support-for-window-icons-_NET_WM_ICON-property.patch
This adds support for displaying the window icons (_NET_WM_ICON) on the
window's title. I find that when I have many windows in tabbed/stacked mode
it's much quicker to find some window if there are icons next to the window
titles. Not needed for kde/i3 integration.

0003-Close-window-s-on-middle-click.patch
This added support for closing a window by middle clicking on it's title.
Not needed for kde/i3 integration.

0004-Don-t-manage-desktop-type-windows-only-map-them.patch
This adds "support" for desktop windows(_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP) by
just mapping them instead of managing them.

0005-Handling-_NET_WM_STATE_STAYS_ON_TOP-window-state-use.patch
Implements support for _NET_WM_STATE_STAYS_ON_TOP window states (useful for
most KDE4 popups).

0006-Allow-focusing-to-change-to-worskpaces-that-are-not-.patch
Allows focus change to workspaces that are not visible. Not needed for
kde/i3 integration.

0007-Workaround-for-resize-to-work-while-krunner-is-start.patch
Window resizing using the mouse doesn't work while krunner is started. This
patch is a workaround to fix that.

0008-Fix-for-invisible-borders-after-restart-when-composi.patch
I using a compositor, after restarting i3 some window borders become
invisible. This patch is a workaround to fix that, not needed for kde/i3
integration.


Hope this helps,
Marius

Marius you are a gentleman, and a scholar! Thanks for taking the time to
produce & provide these patches and info - very much appreciated!

I'll apply these over the weekend, and will send a response with my
results to the list just for follow-up. I'm wondering, you said:

> I have a set of patches on top of the i3 next branch 

... does this mean I can simply compile from git to get these changes
rather than applying them manually?

No, you need to clone the next branch from git and apply the patches on top
of that. Basically, you need to do this:

git clone -b next git://code.i3wm.org/i3
cd i3
# copy the patches inside the i3 directory
git am *.patch
make

Subject: [i3] i3bar POC: workspace button with focused window name
Message-ID: <CABgc4wQgNVYAJZD_52jTMhNii6B0Co4b0PSok70ekZjt_xrfiQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm a new user to i3 and just got some thought on the i3bar ws area.

I always forget what window I put into which workspace. It will be
very helpful if I can see something without switching to it to check
out. Tmux is the example here, where I can rename the current window
to mark what's the topic of the contained windows.

For i3, a static title is easily achieved by mapping key
Mod-{1,2,3...} to a name.
    bindsym $mod+1 workspace 1 - terminal
    bindsym $mod+1 workspace 2 - web

So I can get workspaces as "1 - terminal", "2 - web"... However this
is not flexible at all, what if I want another combination and
workspace type?

The behavior of i3bar could be modified to include the currently
focused window title on each ws button. Such that when I run urxvt in
ws 1 and chrome in ws 2, I'll get two ws buttons like:

[ 1: fam at localhost:~ ] [ 2: Wikipedia - Google Chrome ]

Of course a bar option can be added too to enable/disable this
feature. Or even give some sophisticated format option for the title,
and also enable user to manually rename it. Would this feature be
useful?

To do this we need to add a few new events trigger and maybe a "title"
field in get_workspace msg. I already have a demo modification for you
to test how it feels, based on master. Now my life with many
workspaces is much easier. :)

Welcome to give any feedback!

Best regards!

I think the only modification needed to i3 would be a focus-change-event
(and maybe with a little hack not even that) and what you want can be
entirely done with an ipc-script, no modifications to i3bar necessary.

So I would do it like that: Have a daemon running that listens for focus
events, everytime such an event is triggered, get the current
workspaces, find out for each one, what window is currently focused
(maybe the focus event could include the ?change?-data which would make
this step unnecessary) and change the title of that workspace to the
title of that window.

As I said, I think it could also be possible with a little ?hack?: By
using the workspace-event you could change the title everytime you
change away from a ws. Then you would have accurately titles for every
ws _not_ currently focused, which should be enough for getting an
overview.

I think i3bar is definitely the wrong place to do what you want, though
it is a good idea.
Doing it in i3 (by including an option to change the ws-title to the
currently focused window) would be better, because then the feature
would be available to users of alternative ws-bars, if they exist. But
this would still be a lot of complexity added to i3 in C for something,
that can be done with IPC and a scripting-language.
Implementing the focus-change-event you should do in any case, imho,
because I ran over a few usecases which would profit from that in my
time.


Regards,

Axel

Event is the easiest part, just send an event at the end of `con_focus
for window, as well as handle_destroy_notify_event,
handle_windowname_change, would suffice.

Renaming would be trickier, that would need a remap of key binding
too, which sounds not so neat. IMO "name" of ws and "caption" or
"title" of ws should be isolated, because mixing ws identifier and
it's display is not a good idea, despite the complexity for the
"ipc-script" to decompose and extract the original ws name, and query
and parse the whole tree, and then remap all the keybindings to this
workspace (would be a nightmare if many bindings refer to it) for each
change.

The thing will be much easier if i3 adds a "caption" property to ws,
so that i3bar and other bars can optionally render it to user, and
this also benefits that renaming a workspace becomes more
straightforward (no longer messing any keybinding). Maybe I'm too used
to tmux.

This is <100 LOC for both i3 and i3bar changes, if this feature is
demanded, I can post my patch for review.

actually, you would not need to change your keybinding. you could use 
the i3-command "workspace number <ws-id>" in your config file. Let's 
assume you have workspaces "1: www" and "2: mail". Then configure your 
workspace switchting keys to the following commands:
	bindsym $mod+$1 workspace number 1: www
	bindsym $mod+$2 workspace number 2: mail

if you now rename the current workspace (e.g. 1: www) with "rename 
workspace to '1: foo'", you can still access this workspace with your 
configured keybinding.

Hi,

what justus said was also my first reaction. Everything you explained in
your second mail is pretty much implemented conceptually, with the
?caption? being called name and ?identifier? being the number.
The complexity of the needed ipc-script is reduced accordingly, you only
need something like:
while true:
    wait_for_event
    workspaces = get_workspaces
    for each workspace:
        active_con = null
        for each container:
            if container.focused:
                active_con = container
                break
        workspace.rename("%d: %s", workspace.number, active_con.title)

With one of the libraries existing that encapsulate the
i3-protocol a working script should not be very much longer than the
pseudocode above (I'm actually not sure wether the number-syntax works
in the rename command, if not, that would be a nice thing to implement
too, imho ;).

I also presume that a change as you originally proposed would not be
accepted in the mainline i3, for the reasons I mentioned, but I only
extrapolate from similar proposals in the past.

Kind regards,

Axel

OK, I get it. So the remaining is events, and possibly number syntax in rename.

You got my mind running on this, I thought this would be easily done 
with a custom class using py3status [1] :)
I'm glad to attach the implementation, it works great and should answer 
your initial request.

Basically, with a standard 1sec interval py3status usage, you will have 
a pretty responsive renaming going on. Few thoughts if we wanted to push 
it further :
     - We could an event subscription to handle this in a thread
     - We could avoid using i3-py by using the standard i3-msg so this 
wouldn't need any dependency and would work out of the box

  [1] https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status

One limitation which I didnt have the time to try to fix is that 
renaming the workspaces breaks the window assignment you may have 
configured.

Message-ID: <x61ub3aji1.fsf@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

my hosting provider is physically relocating my dedicated server
starting at 2013-03-29 22:00 CET. He says that all servers will be
running again starting from 2013-03-30 08:30 CET.

The following services will be affected:
? faq.i3wm.org
? bugs.i3wm.org
? cr.i3wm.org
? the i3-discuss mailing list

The following services should not be affected:
? I?ll try to host www.i3wm.org via cloudflare, and if cloudflare?s
  offline mode works, you should be able to read the docs online at
  least.
? The IRC channel #i3 should still be available.

Please do not report any problems with any i3 service during that
downtime and please refer people to this message in case they ask.

Michael

Subject: [i3] Correct scratchpad show behaviour ?
Message-ID: <51519EA3.2070707@imag.fr>

I was experimenting some things with the scratchpad feature, and the 
following totally messed up my current workspace :

bindsym $mod+Shift+P [title=".*"] scratchpad show

If you re-start i3 with an empty scratchpad, open some windows, then 
switch to another workspace and press mod+shift+P, all the windows (even 
if they are not in the scratchpad) will come to that workspace (without 
being switched to floating windows).
However if you add some windows to the scratchpad, then restart i3 and 
do the previous manipulation, only windows from the scratchpad will come 
to the workspace.
It looks like in some cases i3 doesn't check properly if the matching 
windows are in the scratchpad.

I don't think it's the expected behaviour so I'm posting this here.

Regards,
Philippe

I was able to reproduce this. Also, I wrote this patch that fixes it:

I'm not sure why can't I test against current->con->scratchpad_state being
other than 0. That was my original approach, but after logging the value,
it always return 0 on every match. Any idea?

Thanks for the answer, actually your fix doesn't work when you have 
floating windows that are not in the scratchpad.

Actually you can test for the scratchpad_state by taking the parent :
"(current->con->parent->scratchpad_state != SCRATCHPAD_NONE)" does the 
trick.
But there was also some missing tests in scratchpad_show function, since 
two of the "If this was 'scratchpad show' without criteria" doesn't 
check that the given parameter "con" is null.
I don't know exactly what to do with my commit, I assume I should submit 
it to the code review so that's what I will do.

Regards,
Philippe

Message-ID: <20130327135315.GB6674@angelina>

Hi,

I'm trying to set wifi status to be displayed in status bar, but it's
not working. In Debian, my wireless interface is wlan0 and it is
working, but in Slackware it's eth1 and it's not working. 

I edited i3status.conf and replaced default wlan0 with eth1, but no
results. It always displays "W: down" although I'm connected. 

Regards,
Veljkol

You most likely did not edit all the places. Note that you need to also
edit the ?order? directive (e.g. ?order += "wireless wlan0"?).

Hi Michael,

Actually, I think I did.

order += "wireless eth1"

and 

wireless eth1 {
        format_up = "W: (%quality at %essid) %ip"
	format_down = "W: down"
}

Is there any other place that need to be edited?

Regards,
Veljko

That looks correct.

Can you file a ticket at http://bugs.i3wm.org and attach an strace
output of i3status? Use ?strace -f -o /tmp/st.txt -s2048 i3status?,
cancel with Ctrl+C after a few seconds, bzip2 /tmp/st.txt and upload
/tmp/st.txt.bz2.

I tried that, but it seams that my version of i3 is not supported. I'm
using i3 v4.2. I'll try to upgrade to see if that will solve the
problem.
