Hi Michael,

first of all: thank you for i3! I really appreciate your work on that!

I agree with your comments and I have thought about them already. I
don't see the network throughput as accurate measurement but as clue
about what is going on. It is more or less just a hint and I didn't want
to use any extra tools/screen space for that. In my case it was actually
very helpful in finding the culprit. After all, the use of network
throughput is a choice. If a user doesn't like it, they don't have to
add it to their config.
As there seem to be some interest from other users: I could try to trim
the code. A few of the supported architecture are probably not needed
(solaris, hpux, bsd?) although it's nice to have them.

Best regards,
Mathias

P.S.: I think some modules of i3status produce wrong output when using
i3bar output mode. I wanted to fix that but a question arose: what is
this mode supposed to do anyway? The manual of i3bar explicitly wants
output_format to be &quot;none&quot;. Is it just some kind of legacy? We could
trim that too

</PRE>
