<PRE>I've been a user of i3 for a few years now, and I absolutely love it!   I
found i3 after ion2 went out of development, and after trying all the other
tiling window managers out there i3 was far and away the best.   Great
work!

One thing I have noticed is that i3 has some quirks with how it handles
other low level programs that take keyboard input.    Specifically synergy (
<A HREF="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net">http://synergy2.sourceforge.net</A>).  My goal is to be able to have three
screens across two machines, where I run mail and calendaring on one
machine (mac), and everything else on the other (linux).   I want to be
able to use the same modifier key to switch from one machine to the next as
I do to switch windows in i3.   However, i3 doesn't seem to pass the
modifier on to synergy - even if the particular key combination is not
mapped by i3.   So, as example,  if I user &quot;super&quot; as my i3 modifier key,
and then set super+1, super+2, and super+3 to switch to desktops 1,2 and 3
respectively.  Then if I tell synergy that super+4 switches to my mac,
synergy does not get the key combination even though i3 has not explicitely
mapped it.

Is this inherant to the way things work, or is this adjustable?

Thanks,
Daniel Steen
