</I>
Nope. You're cleaning up for the callers, then breaking out of the
loop the next time you return to the loop. What I suggested is that
you propagate the error to the callers and let the callers do the
clean up of their stuff, until you eventually get to the functions
that are called by the event loop itself, which should then decide
whether to break off the loop or not.

In the aforementioned example, function C should clean up its
resources and return an error code to B, which will then check that
return code, clean up its own resources and return an error code to A
and so forth. That way C doesn't have to know B's state, B doesn't
have to know A's state, etc. It's then much easier to manage, much
less likely that you forget to free some resources.
