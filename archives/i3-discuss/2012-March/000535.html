</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, sorry. I made a mistake, I leave out a file in this patch.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> New patch attached.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds great, but I think it would be cleaner to avoid exporting so
</I>&gt;<i> many symbols. For example, for at least some of those calls to exit(),
</I>&gt;<i> can't we just make the function signal to the caller through a return
</I>&gt;<i> code that it has failed? The caller would then signal to his parent
</I>&gt;<i> and so on, until we get to the event handlers. Those handlers know all
</I>&gt;<i> state involved and can cleanly break out of the loop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In case the last sentence became a bit confusing, consider this (-&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> indicates a function call):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Event loop -&gt; Event handler -&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; C
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If C called exit, you're now calling ev_break in C. But then you have
</I>&gt;<i> to export the symbols of stuff that needs to be cleaned up in the
</I>&gt;<i> event handler, in A and in B, so that you can clean up for them. If
</I>&gt;<i> you instead propagate the error across the call stack, C would clean
</I>&gt;<i> after itself and pass the error code to B, which would do the same and
</I>&gt;<i> pass the error code to A, and so on. That way no function has to clean
</I>&gt;<i> up after its parent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That might require some refactoring (e.g. some functions might already
</I>&gt;<i> return something) but it's probably worth it.
</I>If my understanding of ev_break() is right, my patch works quite the
same way as you described.
Event handler will return, and all the clean up is done in main(), no
extra symbols need to be exported.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another option may be only clean up what needs to be cleaned up.
</I>&gt;<i> Memory usually doesn't need to be free'd if the process is going down
</I>&gt;<i> anyways. I'd consider this last resort, but we already do that in the
</I>&gt;<i> signal handler anyways, so it's not like it would be unprecedented.
</I>&gt;<i> You could also call kill_child in an atexit() handler (child_pid would
</I>&gt;<i> have to be initialized to 0), but it's ugly too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also noticed that you call ev_break, but the signal handler calls
</I>&gt;<i> ev_unloop. Is that intentional?
</I>The ev_unloop is from the old code. I just didn't notice that.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally I'd recommend that you split part of the commit message into
</I>&gt;<i> the description. In Git, the first line of the commit message is
</I>&gt;<i> special and it must be short. How about something like this:
</I>Thank you for point that out, I think I'm just too careless about the
commit message....

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i> Use ev_break() instead of exit().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Calling exit() directly would mean we would never clean up. So now we
</I>&gt;<i> break out of the event loop instead. Now we can be sure the child killed
</I>&gt;<i> killed when i3bar exits, for example.
