Hi,

sorry to interrupt in the between of conversation.

a few of mine use cases:

1) When you are on slow / paid connection it is usually good to know
    if anything uses a lot of traffic now.

2) When there is download going, it is good
    to know when its finished without switching to an app.

3) When I talk on Skype or other thing I often use to see if the
    incoming/outgoing traffic does fit well in the current connection
    speed.

4) When I work in terminal and experience delays, quick look into
    network status shows if this is a problem on my side (net load high)
    or somewhere else.

5) It helps to identify troyans or viruses when you see unexpected
    traffic from your desktop.

Those are a few my own use-cases for network load meter in i3wm, it it 
ever would be implemented. I do understand your argument about code size,
and agree that it looks a way too much.

In worsest cases, when I definitely need to watch the traffic, I run
gkrellm. But it does ates a lot of space on screen and so I prefer
not do do this. In old good IceWM sysload and Network Traffic were graphs
nicely integrated into the bar. It would be great if some day we will have
smth. like this.
