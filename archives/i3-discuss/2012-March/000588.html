<PRE>Hi,

Excerpts from Fernando Lemos's message of 2012-02-24 01:13:04 +0100:
&gt;<i> This sounds interesting, but have you discussed it with Michael first?
</I>&gt;<i> I'd recommend always pinging Michael first to see if what you intend
</I>&gt;<i> to do is in line with the project goals and things like that. Unless,
</I>&gt;<i> of course, you don't care about getting your patches merged.
</I>No worries, the patch makes sense (judging from the description).

&gt;<i> Please merge both patches in a single one to make it easier to review
</I>&gt;<i> (unless they do separate things, of course).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed you used &quot;if (&quot; and &quot;if(&quot;, please stick with &quot;if (&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> that's what the rest of xcb.c uses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You declare and read bar_hidden, but you never seem to write to it. Am
</I>&gt;<i> I missing something? Also, I'd rather have the code that calls
</I>&gt;<i> hide/unhide_bar simply not call those functions rather than do the
</I>&gt;<i> checking inside the functions, but that's subjective, I guess.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The indentation level on the call to hide_bars() in the last chunk of
</I>&gt;<i> the second patch is wrong. Are you sure you don't want that enclosed
</I>&gt;<i> by brackets, as part of the &quot;else&quot; branch?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're doing all the logic in the drawing code. Perhaps it would be
</I>&gt;<i> better to detect that stuff directly in the ipc.c, when you receive
</I>&gt;<i> the workspace info from i3, after the call to parse_workspaces_json.
</I>All of Fernando&#8217;s comments are valid.

Do you want to update the patch? If you need any help/have any questions,
please let us know.

Best regards,
Michael
</PRE>
