Subject: [i3] default kbd layout per window
Message-ID: <CABmj=E4AnApJPb6ormCExMmnQs6YtUJUFbcuiTjKM8ZwoUR7ZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi i3wm gurus,

I use i3 with kbdd in order to have different keyboard layouts in different
windows:

exec_always --no-startup-id kbdd
exec_always setxkbmap -layout de,us -option grp:shift_caps_toggle


I figured out that the following command changes the current layout into
the US version:

$  dbus-send --dest=ru.gentoo.KbddService /ru/gentoo/KbddService
ru.gentoo.kbdd.set_layout uint32:1

...and replacing the uint32:1 with uint32:0 switches to the DE layout.


Now, what I couldn't figure out is that how can I set up a default layout
for certain types
of windows.  New windows start with the DE version (I guess because that
one comes
first in the list with the 'setxkbmap -layout de,us' command).  So far, so
go.  But on
terminals I want to use the US layout.  I tried something like this in the
i3wm config:

for_window [window_role="terminal"] exec dbus-send
--dest=ru.gentoo.KbddService /ru/gentoo/KbddService
ru.gentoo.kbdd.set_layout uint32:1

Unfortunately this doesn't work.  Can you please tell me how can I do this
kind of
setup from the i3 config?  (Maybe I could run the dbus-send command from the
bash_profile or something like that, but I hope this can be done with
for_window
in the i3 config somehow.)

Thanks,
Uz.

For_window will only be run when the window is opened, not everytime it is focused. 

What you need to do is hook into the focus event on the IPC, match the window there and execute the command.

That's not a problem.  If the layout is once set for that particular
window,  kbdd will
take care of the focus changes and activate the proper layout if the focus
moves.  All
I want is to set the initial layout to US on the terminal windows and leave
the other
layout as the default for all the rest.

Then I think it should work, assuming your terminal actually has the window role "terminal".

Can you be more specific on how it doesn't work? Can you figure out if the command is run on the wrong window? Also, a log file would be helpful to see how the command is being executed. 

You probably also want to add --no-startup-id to the exec call. I doubt dbus-send does anything with startup notifications.

Yes, the "terminal" role is a-okay.  For example

for_window [window_role="terminal"]  border pixel 22

works fine.  And the dbus-send command also works if it's run from the
terminal.  But
if I start a new terminal with $mod+Enter, it comes up with the wrong
layout.

For testing, I did this (the same dbus-send command bound to $mod+o):

bindsym $mod+o exec --no-startup-id dbus-send --dest=ru.gentoo.KbddService
/ru/gentoo/KbddService ru.gentoo.kbdd.set_layout uint32:1

and pressing $mod+o in the new terminal changes the layout to US, as I
expected.

My guess is that the switching to the US layout happens too early.  Maybe
kbdd kicks in on the
new window just a bit after the US layout was set and kbdd overwrites it
with the default.


This didn't work either:

xte 'keydown Shift_L' 'keydown Caps_Lock' 'keyup Caps_Lock' 'keyup Shift_L'

but this one (that sleeps 0.5 sec before simulating the keypresses) did:

xte 'usleep 500000' 'keydown Shift_L' 'keydown Caps_Lock' 'keyup Caps_Lock'
'keyup Shift_L'

So, this seems to be some stupied timing issue.  I'm sorry about
bothering...

Uz.

If it’s just a timing issue, you may want to add a delay, like this:

for_window [window_role="terminal"] exec --no-startup-id sleep 1 && dbus-send --dest=ru.gentoo.KbddService /ru/gentoo/KbddService ru.gentoo.kbdd.set_layout uint32:1

Subject: [i3] Keep windows focused on workspace move
Message-ID: <4795506.uIXWhWTBxv@asaru>

Hello,

when I move a window from a workspace to another (mod + shift + num) it looses the focus and a window (or parent) of the originating workspace is focused.

How can I have the window to stay focused when moved across workspaces?

Use case:
I have a conversation open on the small and farer away laptop screen. I see activity there and I move it to one of my main screens. I want it to keep focused.

Best Regards,
Florian

Hello.

Try to change your binding from
move workspace «X»
to
move workspace «X», focus workspace «X»

I have set it to:

bindsym $mod+Shift+1 move container to workspace 1, focus workspace 1
bindsym $mod+Shift+2 move container to workspace 2, focus workspace 2
bindsym $mod+Shift+3 move container to workspace 3, focus workspace 3
bindsym $mod+Shift+4 move container to workspace 4, focus workspace 4
[...]

but that shows no effect.

Thanks,
Florian

bindsym $mod+Shift+2 move container to workspace 2,  workspace 2
bindsym $mod+Shift+3 move container to workspace 3,  workspace 3

bindsym $mod+Shift+5 move container to workspace 5,  workspace 5

What are you trying to accomplish with “exec i3-msg workspace $WS1”?
This is equivalent to just “workspace $WS1”, but will be executed
out-of-order because it spawns a new process in the background which
sends the command.

Also, I think the “focus” command used on its own (i.e. without any
criteria) is a no-op.

The previously mentioned “move container to workspace 1, workspace 1”
command is the way to go.

It should work with just "focus" because the separation with a comma
means the focus command will still be ran on the matched window.

Yeah, but bindsym doesn’t match anything. You need to use criteria to
match windows.

Message-ID: <CAGBd4kDEQKXoJcp=k1c6qNo0thnFwAPLNPwc+fw-gtA=2ZHcBQ@mail.gmail.com>

I love i3 but this confuse me a while.
I's possible to enter big picture mode with fullscreen enable, but
after launching game i3 won't focus to the new window but stay.
Is there any config or workaround that could provide the best
experience for big picture mode on i3?

When you say "big picture mode", I understand what i3 calls fullscreen mode
<https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_toggling_fullscreen_mode_for_a_window>
.
Does it work for you simply to switch to full screen after game launch?

I think I remember seeing some hooks that permit you to match certain
actions to certain events.  I can't find the documentation now, but maybe
someone else can fill in.  So I think you can express "when this type of
window maps, I'd like this action (toggle fullscreen) to happen".  (Or
maybe I'm thinking of workspace assignment
<https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_automatically_putting_clients_on_specific_workspaces>
and I'm wrong.)

As far as I understand, (and I don’t know what you mean by big picture
mode, so I’ll just assume you mean fullscreen mode) you are trying
to launch a program with a fullscreen window while running another
program, which already has a fullscreen window. By default i3 prevents
that, as usually when you make a window fullscreen, this means you want
to completely focus on it, and anything that tries to steal that focus
is inhibited. However, this behaviour can be changed. For details, see:
http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_popups_during_fullscreen_mode

Hi all,

Liang is talking about "Steam Big Picture Mode" which is a <hipster 
accent> 10-foot interface for the Steam digital distribution, DRM, 
multiplayer and social networking platform </hipster accent>. Sorry, I'm 
trying to be funny not patronising.

The Big Picture Mode starts in i3's fullscreen mode but launches new 
windows for games/software. Liang's (and my) desire would seem to be for 
these new windows to go fullscreen in front of the Big Picture UI.

Userguide Section 4.20 does not seem to provide an option for the above 
behaviour and I haven't thought of a smart way to workaround this.

Regards,

Have you tried to set popup_during_fullscreen to leave_fullscreen?
If so, please describe how it behaves, and how would you prefer
it to behave instead. If not, try it and do the above.

Thanks.

Hi Mateusz,

Thanks for the advice. Setting "popup_during_fullscreen 
leave_fullscreen" works well. I remember previously (24months ago) 
noting that it was unsatisfactory but I now notice that the behaviour is 
the same as normal mode (ie. steam not in big picture mode). Some games 
do not start fullscreen if in big picture mode or not but with that 
setting they will at least be in front of the big picture UI. I am sure 
that this can be blamed on the games that behave like this and not on i3.

Thanks again!

Subject: [i3] resize with mouse
Message-ID: <CAM4Y7zy2rkNWxQa8YFWX7nU+pQGceG7nfsUzPvmgJ=L43TaPtQ@mail.gmail.com>

I3 lets me resize windows with my mouse in case I should want to use my
mouse.  Is it intentional that there's no mouse cursor feedback when a
click-drag will cause a resize?  (The target seems to be three pixels wide.)

Related, I notice that mouse-initiated horizontal resize works but vertical
does not.  User error, bug, intentional?

Also, more out of curiosity than anything else, is it intentional that a
click and release within that three pixel band always move the mouse to the
center of the band?  Yeah, this is a one pixel shift, so it doesn't matter
to me, but having played with it, I'm now curious if there's a reason for
the jump.

Fwiw, i3 version 4.8 (2014-06-15, branch "4.8").

i3 4.8 is really old. We generally don't support old versions. I'd
recommend updating to 4.10.x and see which of your questions are still
valid.

It's not clear if you're aware of the incredibly convenient "Mod +
RightClick" to drag window resizing. Then you can quickly click just
about anywhere on the screen and be grabbing an edge. The feature may
render your concerns moot.

I was not aware of Mod + RightClick.  That's cool.  Thanks.  And in that
context the warp to boundary makes sense: it makes clear what I'm about to
do.

Mod + RightClick also works for both H and V resize.

So this leaves two questions, since maybe they are bugs, maybe not:

1.  Is it intentional, given that non-mod LeftClick can resize, that there
is no feedback on hovering over a window edge?

2.  And is it a bug that vertical resize doesn't work without Mod?

I haven't seen fit to restart i3 today (work to do), although I grabbed
sources to compile from git master.  I'll check once I've compiled and
restarted.

Not sure what you mean by that. I can resize windows in any direction just fine.

Michael, are we sure that using Xfixes wouldn't make this a whole lot
easier? I'm not familiar with the resizing code, really, but I didn't
quite understand in that issue (#706) why we need separate windows?

I haven’t done much with Xfixes, so I’m not sure, but it sounds like
you have a concrete idea in mind. Feel free to reopen #706 and prove
me wrong :).

Hi there,

I updated from the stable Ubuntu version of i3 to 4.10.4 via the official ppa. After that upgrade I am having a problem with my flash plugin in the browser (chrome and firefox). The plugin is not loaded properly and is not recognized correctly by pages. Any ideas on this? Here is my LOG file: http://logs.i3wm.org/logs/5685057352105984.bz2

Cheers,
Robert

Note that flash is closed-source and hence unsupported by us (we can’t
look at its source, so debugging problems with it is too much effort).
That said, maybe someone else on the list has any insights to share.

I don't understand how the window manager is relevant for this. Are you
sure you didn't also update your browser or flash or anything else?

Hi,

i3 has been a default wm for me for a long time!

Having a problem similar to what has been discussed here:

https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/tiling-window-managers-xcomposite-no-windows-found.34708/

The xcomposite windows cannot be selectable even under i3 like in
Xmonad, however the second reply confirms that it worked fine with
Awesome.

Seems like it is more a problem of the window manager than the
application (obs-studio)! Any inputs?!

Thanks!

Hey,

I can't reproduce this. I can select the windows perfectly well. Please 
update to the latest version of i3 and try again.

Hi Tony,

Thanks for the pointer, the standard ubuntu has i3 at 4.7. I upgraded
to 4.10.x following suit to your advice.

However, the xcomposite windows are detected, but only selectable from
the same i3 workspace where OBS is running. The xcomposite windows
from other windows are listed, but once selected, it replaces with a
red area instead of the window itself.

I don't exactly know what happend. I reinstalled Flash and now its working again. The strange thing was that everything worked fine with Gnome Shell and with an older I3 version on my Laptop. So that lead me to the assumption its caused by the I3 Upgrade. Now everything is fine again. 

I3 is great!

Subject: [i3] How to display in `i3bar` (via `i3status`) the amount of free
	memory
Message-ID: <CA+Tk8fxzU_OK1mhZmPLdc9ZUnLnwhjd_fBoJ3HRkFC-bRqEMiQ@mail.gmail.com>

I've just looked in the `i3status` manual to see how to display the
free memory (as reported by `free`), and found no option.

I understand from the manual that computing the used memory is not
easy, but displaying the total used or free memory (both RAM and swap)
as reported by `free` is quite easy and useful.


My particular usecase is this:  I use quite a few of `tmpfs` instances
mounted for various development purposes, which consume quite a lot of
memory (in terms of GiB) and which spill over to swap (sometimes
leaving me without any memory RAM or swap), and I would like to easily
find out when I'm close to "out-of-memory".

Looking through the i3 mailing list archive I found other usecases of
such a feature:
* `[i3] memory information in i3status` from 1st of April 2015, which
talks about many processes chewing RAM;
* `[i3] memory display` from 15th November 2014, which talks about
image processing applications;


There even seems to be a rejected patch implementing this in `[i3]
[RFC] [PATCH] i3status: memory-stats` from 23th February 2012, or
`[i3] [PATCH] i3status: implements a memory-usage-print` from the same
day.


Thus although the average desktop user never runs out of memory
(either he has enough these days or uses swap), there are people --
especially developers or those using memory intensive applications
like scientific or image processing -- that easily overrun both their
RAM an swap.  For example I have on my laptop 8 GiB RAM and a 32 GiB
swap, and I'm constantly running out of available memory due to the
mentioned `tmpfs` instances.

Thanks,
Ciprian.

The recommended way is to wrap i3status as described in its manpage.

The whole purpose of `i3status` is that it's lightweight both in terms
of resources and OS calls.  Wrapping it in a script that each second
spawns a bunch of processes just to add memory usage is counter to its
purpose...

But anyway, as this is an open-source project where development is
done voluntarily (and for free), and as I don't have time right now to
patch it, I'll live it at this...  (Moreover as with the previous
patches there is a high chance the patch won't be accepted in
upstream, leaving me to maintain my own fork of it, which I have even
less time for...)  :)

However I would like to ask the developers to please reconsider adding
such a basic and useful piece of information.  (But as said I'll live
this here.)

Thanks for i3,
Ciprian.

You can use a higher-level language to wrap i3status.

We don’t have a great mental framework for deciding what goes into
i3status and what doesn’t. The current state of affairs is that things
that I deemed useful 7 years ago (wow, time flies) are in i3status,
and we’re very conservative when it comes to adding new things (or
even removing things that I wouldn’t add if I were to start from
scratch, like cpu temperature).

Other status bars (j4status, py3status, etc.) might be better suited
for your use-case.

There are several alternatives to i3status.  I haven't had time to try any
of them.  I have been using conky for years, so I use it.

In my config file I have:

bar {
    output             HDMI1
    tray_output        HDMI1
    status_command     conky -c ~/.i3/conkyrc.left
    mode               dock
    position           bottom
    workspace_buttons  yes
    font               $font

    colors {
    background         $root
    statusline         $foreground
    focused_workspace  $foreground $focused   $foreground
    active_workspace   $foreground $active    $foreground
    inactive_workspace $foreground $unfocused $foreground
    urgent_workspace   $urgentfg   $urgentbg  $urgentfg
    }
}

I have two monitors.  Both conky files have the following settings at the
top of the file:

background no
use_xft yes
out_to_console yes
out_to_x no
update_interval 2
total_run_times 0
double_buffer yes
border_inner_margin 0
border_outer_margin 0
use_spacer none
if_up_strictness address
short_units yes

In file for my left monitor I have:

TEXT
BKK ${tztime UTC-7 %T} \
 CCSD ${tztime PST8PDT %T} \
 PT-0{1,2,3} ${tztime MST7MDT %T}    |    \
en01 ${addr eno1} ${downspeed eno1} ${upspeed eno1}  \
 ${if_up tun0}  tun0 ${addr tun0} ${downspeed tun0} ${upspeed tun0}
 ${endif} \
 port ${tcp_portmon 1 65535 count}    |    \
$nodename ($kernel) $uptime \
 ${time %F %T}

In the file for the right monitor I have:

TEXT
CLP $cpu=${cpu cpu0}+${cpu cpu1} \
 $loadavg \
 $running_processes / $processes    |    \
MS $mem/$memmax ($memperc%) \
 $swap/$swapmax ($swapperc%)    |    \
D / ${fs_used /}/${fs_size /}    |    \
G ${execi 50 if pgrep sandbox > /dev/null ; then genlop -cn | grep
'Currently merging'  ; else echo -n Las Sync: ; ~/.i3/lastsync.sh ; fi}
 |    \
HKUT $nodename ($kernel) $uptime \
 ${time %T}

Some of this is specific to gentoo and needs gentools.

Just in case you are using i3bar in hide mode: In that case i3bar will
SIGSTOP i3status anyway, when the bar isn't shown, so this won't be a
huge problem. :) If you use it in docked mode of course, you are kind of
out of luck with this.

If you don't mind using an alternative to i3status, i3pystatus us an
excellent project - https://github.com/enkore/i3pystatus. There are
many modules written for it including one for memory -
