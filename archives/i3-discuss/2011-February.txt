Subject: [i3] "mode" keyword in config not working?
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=8Jh6_7hnKXDoKW1DAAa-kgXjLV3a_GmANZZ-6@mail.gmail.com>

I followed the User's Guide and setup a "resize" 'mode', as per:
  http://i3.zekjur.net/docs/userguide.html#resizingconfig

However, when I restart i3 it complains it doesn't understand "mode" and
exits.  Is this example in User's Guide still valid?  What version of i3 do
I need?  Am currently running 3.d-bf1.

3.d-bf1 is *ANCIENT*. Please compile your own version and/or get rid of ubuntu :-p.

Subject: [i3] resizing i3 in a virtual desktop
Message-ID: <AANLkTikSaraKrt3ti4bjCWQVRs7mz1YD9fnUSt2BPufs@mail.gmail.com>

I run i3 on a remote machine, using a virtual desktop ("nx"). I have the
virtual desktop displayed in a window (as opposed to fullscreen) on the
local system/workstation. When I resize this window, i3 does not adjust the
"resolution" of the desktop to fit the new size.  Is there an easy way to
get i3 to resize?  wmii does this automatically somehow...

Oh wow, just checked Downloads section... 3.d-bf1 is December 2009.  Ouch.
 Why did I think it was vaguely recent?? :P

Subject: [i3] couple of questions, maybe bugs
Message-ID: <4D556672.9020303@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm new to i3 but I already love it. I'm using version 3.e-bf2.
I have a couple of questions tho:

- documentation is telling about "stack-limit" option. Should it not be 
new_container stack-limit?
- opening a new terminal (MOD+Enter) in stacked or tabbed mode causes 
that new window to blink with urgent colors. It's like it was receiving 
a urgent flag for a split second just after it's created. It's not 
happening in default mode. It's a bit annoying and looks like a bug.
- when I try to run ratmen (simple menu program) then I'm getting 
segmentation fault from it. The same configuration works fine on wmii. 
Any ideas please?

Michael

No, 'new_container stack-limit' sets the default stack-limit for new
containers. If you want to set a stack limit for a particular container, you
can issue the 'stack-limit' command using IPC.

That sounds like a bug. Which terminal emulator do you use?

Well, generate a backtrace. See http://i3.zekjur.net/docs/debugging.html

Subject: [i3] Specifying workspace with Xinerama
Message-ID: <AANLkTin7ytMit39p6Ad1V+T8Y7V7RbUN-XKmiUV3QH50@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a dual monitor setup with nVidia Twinview.  When i3 starts, it
defaults workspace 1 to the left monitor (coordinate 0, 0) and workspace 2
to the other one.
I want workspace 1 to be on my right side, so I tried to specify this in i3
config file

workspace 1 output DFP-0

But this does not seem to work well.  Do I understand correctly that the
output labeling is done by xrandr and nvidia driver is not completely
compatible with it?

Any help would be great.

Thanks.

Minjae

If I understand you correctly, what you are looking for is the output name
xinerama-0, xinerama-1, etc. You could also have checked the logfile, see
http://i3.zekjur.net/docs/debugging.html

Thanks. How is it different from the packages by cassmodiah (see [1])?
