Subject: [i3] Binding adventures between mappings
Message-ID: <CAM4Y7zyoY-wv1JqVQ+E8QSM65WLxdRC4OnujgKW35iv=CKUarA@mail.gmail.com>

I said that wrong in the subject, let me try in more than one line:

I have a somewhat modal idea of how to interact with a window manager, so
my i3 config binds very little at global level, the rest is in modes.  One
mode I call "focus", because the items in that mode I might want to do
without leaving the mode, mostly moving between windows.  In mode "i3",
most of the bindings end with a mode command, often back to "default".

I have this in my $HOME/i3/.config:

set $mod Mod1
bindsym $mod+Tab mode "i3"

mode "i3" {
    # Some things I might want to do.
    # Includes a transition to focus mode.

    # The mode is long, but here's an example:
    bindsym c  exec urxvt; mode "default"
}

mode "focus" {
    # A handful of actions that I want in a separate mode.

    # And then there's a bunch of move/resize bindings, and then:

    # If I forget where I am, do the right thing.
    bindsym $mod+Tab mode "i3"

    # Get me out of here.
    bindsym Return     mode "default"
    bindsym Escape     mode "default"
    bindsym Control+g  mode "default"
}

This works great but for two bindings in "focus" mode:

1.  The $mod+Tab binding I would expect to drop me into "i3" mode, but it
has no effect.

2.  The ESC and C-G bindings exit "focus" mode correctly, but RET has no
effect.

Any suggestions what I've done wrong?

These work for me. I suggest you open an issue on Github and include log
files.
Make sure to restart i3, then press the shortcuts and then take the log
file, that way the file stays relatively small.

Subject: [i3] Reloading i3wm and saving layout
Message-ID: <CACaqnaRoYpTnVb+k9hyV4peye7NWGJ81Ns5qRp46TpqKBJkD3A@mail.gmail.com>

So, been using i3wm for a bit over a year across multiple distros (Debian6,
7 and Testing; Ubuntu 14.04, 14.10 and 15.04; now Arch).

When pressing MOD+R to reload i3wm, it's always annoyed me that it doesn't
keep my terminal layouts (usually stacks them on the screen I am on).

Today while monitoring journalctl, I noticed some interesting logs:

Jul 04 00:27:30 river /usr/lib/gdm/gdm-x-session[1200]: 07/04/2015 12:27:30

AM - ERROR: Could not create "/run/user/1000/i3" for storing the restart
layout, layout will be lost.

It says that this file exists:

/run/user/1000/i3

And indeed this directory does.

Could this be the bane of my annoyances?

i3 version 4.10.2 (2015-04-16, branch "4.10.2")

Though it doesn't matter - been like this ever since I started using i3wm
on Debian (6, 7, and Testing), Ubuntu (14.04, 14.10, 15.04) and Arch for
over a year.

Maybe I am missing a configuration parameter...

Just wanted to mention that I remember having the same thing on Debian
wheezy, although I did not look at the logs and it went away when I moved
to Ubuntu 12/14. I also did revamp my config at the same, so it could have
been related to that.

To me, this sounds like a bug, but I’m not yet sure where precisely it is
:).

Eric, can you please file an issue at https://github.com/i3/i3? When you
file it, please include the version of i3 as well as a logfile (as the
instructions ask you to). In addition, can you please include the output of
“ls -lR /run” and “mount”?

Thanks.

Finally had time to sit down and do this.

@Michael: I opened an issue on Github:

https://github.com/i3/i3/issues/1810

And I made a comment of what I propose the fix to be: have the mkdir()
function ignore if the directory already exists.
