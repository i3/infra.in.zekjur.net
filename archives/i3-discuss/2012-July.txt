Alright, I'll do as you say.

But can you explain this a little further? All the workspaces events is
sent after the render commands have been sent to Xorg. So what schedule
would make i3bar's unmap command arrive before i3's render commands?

Actually, ipc_send_event("workspace", ?) is called in _workspace_show in
src/workspace.c, which is called before tree_render() is called (see
src/commands.c:cmd_workspace for example).

So, i3bar can get the IPC event before i3 even sends the commands to
Xorg and thus it can send an unmap.

Best regards,
Michael

That's right, and I'm aware of that. And that's why I made this patch,  
which block those events until tree_render() has been actually called.

Alright. I was talking about the state before your patch, you were
talking about after your patch :).

Anyway, we already agreed on the solution we want to pursue, so let?s
end this discussion (unless you have further questions).

Hi,

Since I failed to convince Michael to accept my newer patch, I decide to
drop those more "advanced" patch, and try to push this simple patch into i3.

I think it's fine. The original hide/unhide logical is done in draw_bar as
well, I just follow it. And I think the logical is simple enough to be
included in drawing code.

Thanks for updating your patch. Here are my comments:

1) You are not using FREE(last_urgent_ws);, but free(last_urgent_ws) in
   line 1489, which is unsafe (it is not guaranteed that last_urgent_ws
   is != NULL).

2) You are using strdup() instead of sstrdup() in line 1490, so you
   don?t handle -EMEMORY.

3) Instead of using if (last_urgent_ws) free(last_urgent_ws); you should
   use FREE(last_urgent_ws) in line 1526.

4) Your patch doesn?t actually work when the user is not navigating away
   from the workspace using the keyboard, but when he is focusing the
   urgent window with the mouse. i3bar will properly update the urgency
   indicator for that workspace, but it won?t hide.

   I?d suggest to save a flag which is set to true when i3bar calls
   unhide_bars() due to an urgent workspace. Then, check if that flag is
   set, but no more urgent workspaces are found (!has_urgent &&
   !mod_pressed && hidden_due_to_urgency) and call hide_bars().

Best regards,
Michael

Message-ID: <CAHxQA0FKQs+o5rrY9A=MA7XMz+NPoL2hNg67uQz74micwrabhQ@mail.gmail.com>

First off,  Great WM.   I had been sitting on an outdated FC14 distro for a
long time for fear of gnome3's wrath and finally freed myself of my gnome
handcuffs (or so I thought) by switching to i3.  Today I upgraded to FC17
and have noticed that some apps (Rhythmbox in particular) are highly
integrated into the gnome3 cult;  Namely support for closing the apps to
the tray has been obsoleted.

How are people generally dealing with apps like this that have gone off the
gnome3 deep end?  I hate gnome3 if you couldn't tell.

But when trying to install i3, i get the following dependencie

Some dependencies of i3-wm are not satisfied:

How can i resolve these problems (without running in some kind of dependency

Unless you're running the Debian-based Linux Mint, you might want to
give the Ubuntu repositories a shot instead:

Message-ID: <4FF9CAD9.1050304@polibyte.com>

Hi,

I wanted to share with the group a program I wrote for visualizing the 
i3 tree structure. Here's an example of what it produces:

|$  i3tree
Workspace 1 (horizontal)
         Window foo at bar: ~
         Split (vertical)
                 Window foo at bar: ~
                 Window foo at bar: ~
Workspace 2 (vertical)
         Window foo at bar: ~
         Window foo at bar: ~|


https://github.com/sciurus/i3tree

I hope you find it useful. Pull requests with improvements are welcome.

All the best,
Brian

Neat. FYI, for anyone running Arch, the AUR dependency I needed to
install was "aur/perl-anyevent-i3".

And community/perl-x11-protocol is also needed.

Subject: [i3] Gesture recognizer dev approach
Message-ID: <CALOS=hfER27DGep5GWv9x60C3eJT-wChhBG1bxk9S31ahahafQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,
I am going to start writing a gesture recognizer for utilizing pointer
devices (singe/multi touch) on linux as a front end to window managers. I
wanted to hear your opinions on it before actually starting the development.

I'm thinking of a layered structure like this
__gesture recognizer
__gesture recognizer interface for window manager
__window-manager
So, simply, a gesture recognizer is gonna be an app that prints an
identifier when a gesture is recognized
The middle layer is going to read those identifiers, and send commands to
the window manager
And the window manager is... the window manager.

I'd like the user to be able to change to a different gesture recognizer
without having to do too much tweaking. I'd like it to be usable on all the
window managers.

There are obvious issues though
Say "gr1","gr2","gr*" are gesture recognizers. They print an identifier
like "close-win","switch-next-workspace" etc.
"i3wm-gr-interface", "blackbox-gr-interface" etc are various middle layer
applications
"i3wm", "blackbox" etc are the window managers

consider the middle layer:
* i3wm-gr-interface will likely be implementing i3wm-ipc-protocol.
* blackbox-gr-interface however will implement xlib
And sadly, there are not many window managers like i3 that's easy to
communicate with. For example when I need to list available workspaces in a
window manager other than i3, I will have to implement workspaces myself,
because there is no means of learning about them from blackbox. When this
is the case, it's better to embed the gesture recognizer within the window
manager.

Should I just stick with writing a gesture recognizer for i3wm only? This
way, the top and the middle layers can be put together. This will be my
route of choice, unless I learn about a way window managers can be
communicated with.

I don't plan on creating an online repo for my code until it has a working
demo, unless people would like me to. I plan to develop using C, and finish
it in a month's time, if things go as I'd like them to.

That's all, cheers.

Sweet. It doesn?t properly display scratchpad windows, though (while
it does list the __i3_scratch pseudo workspace).

In case you want to get rid of the X11::Protocol dependency, you could
upgrade to AnyEvent::I3 0.10 (which I just released). It figures out the
socket path automatically (just like the script does with X11::Protocol,
but AnyEvent::I3 just calls i3 --get-socketpath instead).

Michael

Most window managers implement enough of the EWMH spec to support
pagers. You can use that to get information about the workspaces as
well as request that the window manager switches to a different
workspace.

I knew about ICCCM but not this. I'll check this one out.
If it's good enough, I think I'll go for the two layered approach, it will be easier.

Message-ID: <CAAuVr72bux9X8tjJ3+Bu1hoT5E1Jd--j=xaL6b-fp_rugbq0YQ@mail.gmail.com>

Sorry if this topic has been discussed here already (did not find it).
I am interest in knowing a bit more about compiling i3wm from source, and
running my own version... but I am having some small problems to do it, and
I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction.

For instance, cloning the source from git:

$ git clone git://code.i3wm.org/i3
$ cd i3
$ make
In file included from src/auto_detect_format.c:15:0:
include/i3status.h:7:21: fatal error: confuse.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
make: *** [src/auto_detect_format.o] Error 1

Any ideas of what could be the problem? I checked the dependencies, but I
am not sure which one could it be.
I am running it on Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit by the way.

Any help is appreciated!

Perhaps libconfuse-dev is what you need? ;)

Remember, you'll likely need the "-dev" versions of all of i3's
dependencies to compile it from source.

On Debian confuse.h is part of the libconfuse-dev package, I would
assume that is the same on Ubuntu. Do you have that package installed?

Before compiling, run "sudo apt-get build-dep i3-wm". This will install all
the libraries i3 depends on.

This output is fake. You are compiling i3status, but you?re telling us
you compile i3.

Use our auto-builder repository, see

Thanks guys.... It is a bit painful to go through all dependencies (and
package naming conventions)... now I got stuck in the :

$ make
[libi3] CC fake_configure_notify.c
In file included from fake_configure_notify.c:14:0:
../include/libi3.h:19:29: fatal error: xcb/xcb_keysyms.h: No such file or
directory
compilation terminated.
make[1]: *** [fake_configure_notify.o] Error 1
make: *** [libi3/libi3.a] Error 2

But installing all I could think of (xcb-proto libxcb1 libxcb1-dev
libxcb-util0 libxcb-util0-dev), and still nothing...

The autobuilder option seems interesting, but apt-get says I am already in
the latest version... should I use a --resintall flag?

Anyways, I guess I'd better get it compilable locally, because I want to do
some changes in the code myself, and test it properly.


Thanks.

Looking at packages.debian.org and searching for "file in 
package" will give

   libxcb-keysyms1-dev

for stable. I always resort to this webpage, if apt-cache search 
does not help me.

You are a saviour! I can't believe I survived that long without such tool!
Worked awesomely! Cheers for that!

For reference, these are the packages I had to install to compile i3wm in
Ubuntu 12.04:

 libconfuse-dev pkg-config xcb-proto libxcb1-dev libxcb-util0-dev
libxcb-keysyms1-dev bison libxcb-icccm4-dev libyajl-dev
libstartup-notification0-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libev-dev flex
libxcursor-dev  libxcb-xinerama0-dev
 asciidoc (requires 800MB of additional packages, so I decided not to
install it)

What is the best way to "debug" (meaning, verify) your changes?

For i3status, for instance, what I am doing now is: change code, compile,
install, logout, login, verify...
Is there a better (on the fly) way to do this?

I tried also to kill/start i3status, but i3bar stops refreshing.

Awesome. I thought that would only "reload" the configuration... it does
restart i3 stuff! Neat!

Alternatively you can install apt-file, which does the same job.

This behavior is intended, so user can easily (using only his mouse)

There is no such guarantee needed for free() as per the C99 Standard:

7.20.3.2 The free function
2 The free function causes the space pointed to by ptr to be
deallocated, that is, made
available for further allocation. If ptr is a null pointer, no action occurs.

Subject: [i3] focus issue
Message-ID: <5005B493.6010703@gmail.com>

Hi guys!

I've read through the archive and did not find anything regarding my 
problems so here I go recreating my problems:

I open two terminal windows (mod+enter, twice), then move the mouse back 
and forth between them, focus follows.
Then, I mark some lines in one of the terminals, move my pointer back to 
the other terminal, focus does not follow there.
Clicking the terminal does not cause the focus to follow. When I use the 
keyboard to switch the focus it works, but then moving my pointer back 
to the first terminal the focus will not follow again.

This is the most simple example, there are more, much more annoying 
implications this bug (if this is one) brings with it. For example:

Using thunderbird, pressing ctrl+m will spawn the new mail window, but 
the focus is screwed up again like in the example before.
If a dialog pops up (focused) and I click something on it my click goes 
right through the dialog into the container behind it.

There are much more issues, if you need more, I will send more.

The only thing helping to regain the ability to focus normally is to 
switch to another workspace and back. But toggling workspaces after 
every click is quite cumbersome, so, what do I do?

I'm using "i3-wm 4.2-2" on a x86_64 archlinux standard kernel and tried 
the forums there already one year ago, but nobody could help.

Can you?

Best regards,
David

Hello every one,
I am writing to ask that, is it possible to set / reset the
orientation of workspaces without restart i3wm?

E.g., bind it to a key:

bindsym $mod+t orientation vertical
bindsym $mod+Shift+T orientation horizontal

Thanks.

Yours, M.W.

Yes, simply use the 'split v' and 'split h' commands on the workspace
level. The 'focus parent' command might come in helpful for that (it
goes up one level in the tree), see [1].

Michael

I hit the same problem and found three ways to solve it:

1. Downgrade to xf86-video-intel-2.18.0-3. There is no need to
downgrade kernel; all you need is rebuild the package (i.e. via ABS) to
link it against new versions of libraries. Note that occasionaly you'll
have to rebuild it again after system upgrades.

2. Downgrade to cairo-1.10.2-3 (possibly newer version prior to
1.12.2-2 will do). I tried it after reading comments to bug
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48395 and it also solved
the problem (without downgrading xf86-video-intel).

3. Replace xf86-video-intel-uxa with xf86-video-intel-sna. This may not
work for every platform, but this solution seems to be the most
convenient since it doesn't require keeping outdated packages in the
system.

Hope it hepls.

Those shouldn't happen. If you're still being able to reproduce this,
please take a look at the bug tracker to see if they haven't been
reported yet, and if not, please report them.

Also please check the debugging guide:

I wanted to drop a small change I made,
as the "layout" field seems as necessary as the "orientation" one.

For example an horizontal container can have either a tabbed or default 
layout.
Conversely, a default layout can be oriented vertically or horizontally.

Here is an example with my "usual" desktop,
using obvious modifications to your script.

Workspace __i3_scratch (default - none)
Workspace 1 (default - horizontal)
     Split (tabbed - horizontal)
         Split (stacked - vertical)
             Window i3: i3-msg(1) - Mozilla Firefox
         Split (stacked - vertical)
             Window Inbox - layus.on at gmail.com - Mozilla Thunderbird
             Window Write: Re: [i3] i3 tree visualization program - 
Unicode (UTF-8)
Workspace 2 (default - vertical)
     Window rxvt-256color
     Window Terminal

I think that the orientation can even be omitted as it is superseded by 
the layout in most cases,
except the one cited above, with the default layout.

Am I right if I say that the default layout is the only one to be 
influenced by the orientation ?

Best regards,
Layus.

PS : Using a "complicated" layout as in workspace 1 often causes i3 to 
crash when moving windows around.
I'm going to fill some bug report, or investigate this furthermore in 
the following days.

Hi,

I will be ordering i3 t-shirts soon. If you want one, too, just send me
an email containing your t-shirt size and full address. Payment is
upfront via paypal or bank transfer, the price for a t-shirt is 15 ? +
shipping. The deadline for email orders is 2012-07-25 (in 3 days). I
will order the shirts shortly afterwards (so expect 2 to 3 weeks from
now until you get them).

The shirt will look like the one in this picture:
http://twitpic.com/36lomv (but the URL will be i3wm.org)

Michael

Any chance for size table?
I have strange experiences with sizes ordered form US,
where L fits like XL.

Any idea what is shipping cost to London, UK?
I could also get it shipped to Dortmund in Germany, then collect it myself.

The shirts will be "Hanes Top T" a size table can be found on this
(german) page:

My attempt at a translation for those who don?t understand german:

Subject: [i3] i3status with battery at 100+
Message-ID: <CAAuVr72FRTG8peBzHN-vtjew0_kMbJX_=Vf7e8=FZu+_w0eUSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

It is really a small thing, but decided to write about it anyway...

I know it is not a i3 bug, because the proc/acpi is returning this
wrongfully. I wonder if it is worth trying to improve this or better just
leave it... I was thinking about working on it, if you guys reckon it is
worth the trouble:

1) never allow battery value to surpass 100% (this happens specially while
using last full capacity) - this is not a bug, but it makes no sense to
display as such
2) the state shows charged but i3status displays BAT, as in discharging (I
believe this is a bug)
3) when the charging is close to 100%, the battery goes red (I believe this
happens because of the remaining time to become full - and looks like a bug
as well)

What do you guys think?

Rule of thumb: Please always describe what you are seeing. From your
screenshots, I think you are talking about your battery having a charge
status of more than 100%. While this might seem odd at first you have to
understand that the design capacity is only a value which the
manufacturer of the battery sets. It is perfectly normal that batteries
achieve more than that in their first few discharge cycles. Just as it?s
normal that the battery won?t achieve the full design capacity after
some discharge cycles :).

> 1) never allow battery value to surpass 100% (this happens specially while

It does make sense to display it. The information that your battery is
fuller than normal is important, too.

> 2) the state shows charged but i3status displays BAT, as in discharging (I

Does this happen all the time? If so, can you check if your battery
uevent file contains the POWER_SUPPLY_STATUS key and which value it has
please?

> 3) when the charging is close to 100%, the battery goes red (I believe this

This is weird. The remaining time is only checked when the state is
'discharging'. But it displays CHR (charging) in your screenshot. Fixes
welcome.

Message-ID: <CALzASJnB8RcX7LUZ7t4i-aOcBkVizhfUPwtvXz8HTA9fSyU-dQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I'm currently switching from wmii to i3. It seems to work well so far,
but just have to make the last things work before I can use i3 all the
time.

I'm trying to get mod+t and mod+shift+t to work like in wmii. That
will say that mod+t should shift to a workspace selected by dmenu and
mod+shift+t should move the current window to a workspace selected by
dmenu. My solution so far is:

#switch to dmenu-selected-tag
bindsym Mod3+t exec bash -c 'cat /dev/null | dmenu | xargs -i i3-msg
workspace {}'

#move window to dmenu-selected-tag
bindsym Mod3+Shift+t exec bash -c 'cat /dev/null | dmenu | xargs -i
i3-msg move container to workspace {}'


That works well. The only problem is that dmenu doesn't get any list
of currently available workspaces. Is there a way I can get this list?

And PLEASE don?t use shell to parse this. It?s SO easy to do it in any

Thanks. It works well using JSON::PP in perl.

My next small project to migrate is to make alt-<letter> jump to the
last selected workspace beginning with <letter> and the next workspace
beginning with letter if already on that workspace. The mechanism
therefore has to know both about workspace changes as well as key
presses. To not get too many perl modules to install all the places I
need to run i3, I think it looks like the easiest way is to have one
script monitoring workspace changes with AnyEvent::I3 and save the
changes to a file in /tmp and another script that is referenced in a
bind in .i3/config that receives the letter, reads the file in /tmp
and then select the right workspace with i3-msg. This way perl
shouldn't need to know about X.

Is there a more easy way to do this?

Instead of using i3-msg at all, you can do everything using
AnyEvent::I3.

No, it?s the same way I would do it right now.

Message-ID: <20120726110831.12156.48627@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

in the past, we have briefly discussed using Code Review Software such
as Gerrit, Review Board and others for i3. Back then, we came to the
conclusion that none of the available tools is easy and compelling
enough to be used as-is and that the effort of starting something is too
high to be justified (see below).

I have serious doubts about the effort not being justified anymore. Code
Reviews as we do them currently (in a mixture of comments via IRC, trac
or our mailing list) pose a high cognitive load for me and a frustrating
experience for (potential) contributors.

Quite a while ago, I wrote about the features and non-features which I?d
like to see in an ideal code review system:
http://www.featurequest.org/FRQ$CodeReview

Now my question is: Who of you would actively (!) help developing such a
system?

Best regards,
Michael

PS: In case anyone wonders why we don?t like existing software:
? It?s often complex to use. The situation usually is that you have a
  patch and you want to get comments on it. Most existing tools require
  you to sign up first and then fill in a lot of fields. For reviewers,
  getting to the actual side-by-side diff takes far too many clicks (it
  should be precisely 1).
? Most don?t allow anonymous submissions, but we really need that (as we
  do in our bugtracker).
? Some don?t even accept the git format-patch output (Rietveld for
  example).
? Some require you to give up control over your git repository (Gerrit).

I think you misunderstood me. What FREE does is it sets the pointer to
NULL after calling free(). Therefore, the following code works fine:

    FREE(last_urgent_ws);
    // ?things happen here, and much later:
    FREE(last_urgent_ws);

While the following is not:

    free(last_urgent_ws);
    // ?things happen here, and much later:
    free(last_urgent_ws); // points to an old memory location

Several weeks ago I came across barkeep (via thechangelog.com):
http://getbarkeep.org/

While it looks like a non-trivial setup, it may have some of the other
functionality you mentioned.

This looks pretty awesome, thanks for the link! I think with a bit of
custom script magic I can implement our workflow using barkeep. I?ll let

I find code review workflow proposed by GitHub very easy and compelling:

https://github.com/features/projects/codereview

Plus, there are some nice extensions:

http://reviewth.is/

If GitHub is not kosher, GitLab offers very similar workflow http://gitlabhq.com

Hi,

I would really like to write the desired Software and I would use django
for it. I would be ready for doing this alone, but of course I'd be
happy about some help. I have planned on writing such a service anyway,
without a target. I agree with the mentioned needs and restrictions.

Best regards,

Max A. Busse

That?s nice to hear. I?d be happy to betatest anything you come up with.

By the way, I evaluated barkeep briefly. Here are my observations:

 ? Deployment is horrible, as with most ruby projects :-/
 ? Documentation is really sparse, and the existing documentation
   contained two errors (I opened an issue for one and fixed the other
   one right away).
 ? The only distinction is between admin/normal users, that is, you
   cannot specify who?s able to comment or approve commits (not that
   approving has any effect, but?).
 ? Authentification is possible only via OAuth with a horrible user
   experience. You are directly redirected to the configured OAuth
   provider (e.g. google) without any message. This is the biggest
   problem for my intended use. We really need to be able to create user
   accounts automatically to hand them out after somebody uploads a
   patch.
 ? barkeep only supports a post-commit workflow. This means I?d have to
   build a site (and/or script) to upload patches and then have them be
   committed to a new branch automatically. No big deal, but see the
   points above ? after all, it?s not really worth it I think.

I have to stress that barkeep really does it right in the user
interface. A list of commits, a nice diff and comments is really all I
want to have. I just think adjusting it is not that easy for now.

Best regards,
Michael

Hi. I've figured out to get the current workspace with AnyEvent::I3.
I've also figured out to get a call back when the workspace changes.
But when I combine it I get an error, as it seems like I can't call
get_tree() while I'm in a call back. I've made a small script to show
the problem:

#!/usr/bin/perl

use warnings;
use strict;
use AnyEvent::I3;

my $i3=i3();
$i3->connect();
if ($i3->connect->recv) {
  print "Connected to i3\n";
}
my %callbacks = (
  workspace => sub { i3->get_tree->recv}
);

while ($i3->subscribe(\%callbacks)->recv) {};


Which give the following output (second line first when I switch workspace):

Connected to i3
AnyEvent::CondVar: recursive blocking wait attempted at
/home/fuzz/perl5/lib/perl5/AnyEvent/I3.pm line 339

Am I doing something wrong?

/Anders

There?s no need to call ->connect twice. Kill the first line.

> while ($i3->subscribe(\%callbacks)->recv) {};
Ugh, this is very wrong. You should only subscribe once, not in a loop.
Also, as you have noticed, you cannot call ->recv "twice". Instead, use:

#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use AnyEvent::I3;
use EV;
use Data::Dumper;

my $i3 = i3();
$i3->connect->recv;
my %callbacks = (
        workspace => sub {
                my $tree = i3->get_tree->recv;
                print "tree = " . Dumper($tree) . "\n";
        }
);
$i3->subscribe(\%callbacks)->recv;
EV::loop;

(I have noticed a few strange things while hacking up this example, so there
might be a new release of AnyEvent::I3 soon ;-)).

Best regards,
Michael

Hi Michael. Thanks. That made it work.

If you update it I think it would be good with the call to EV::loop in
the example for subscribe().
