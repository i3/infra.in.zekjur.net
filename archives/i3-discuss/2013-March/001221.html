Hello list members!

I've been running and enjoying i3 for a few months now and 
have been very pleased with it.  Prior to i3, I was using
a minimal kde session + kwin; and I find that I still want
to use some of the conveniences/features/apps I enjoyed in
kde.

So I managed to get kde to use i3wm as alternative to kwin
last night, however I'm running into issues - I'm hoping
someone here might have some suggestions or comments:

#1 - attempting to run krunner always crashes i3 (v. 4.5)

#2 - I can't see any of the system-tray items unless I
     run a plasma panel - I don't see how to get kde
     plasma tray items in the i3bar

#3 - I'm having a tough time figuring out how to properly
     exit kde when i3 is the wm: if I mod-alt-e to exit
     i3, then things hang in an F'd up state because i3
     exited, but kde is still lingering


Basically, I'd like to just use i3wm for its window-handling
and management, but I'd like to use as much of kde and 
kde-integration as possible.


So I guess I can list this another way - what I'd like to 
be able to do:

* access system-tray stuff either via a kde panel, or via
  i3bar/i3status.

* execute krunner without crashes, possibly use krunner
  in lieue of dmenu if possible.

* be able to properly exit/logout-of the kde session


Anyone else using i3 as an alternative to kwin in a mostly 
kde environment, primarily for i3's tiling window management 
features?


Thanks for any assistance, much appreciated! I did spend
quite a bit of time last night experimenting and hunting
google and forums for solutions, but to no avail.
