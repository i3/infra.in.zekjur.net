</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I would do it like that: Have a daemon running that listens for focus

</I>&gt;<i> workspaces, find out for each one, what window is currently focused

</I>&gt;<i> this step unnecessary) and change the title of that workspace to the
</I>&gt;<i> title of that window.
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said, I think it could also be possible with a little &#8222;hack&#8220;: By

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think i3bar is definitely the wrong place to do what you want, though

</I>&gt;<i> Doing it in i3 (by including an option to change the ws-title to the

</I>&gt;<i> this would still be a lot of complexity added to i3 in C for something,
</I>&gt;<i> that can be done with IPC and a scripting-language.
</I>&gt;<i> Implementing the focus-change-event you should do in any case, imho,
</I>&gt;<i> because I ran over a few usecases which would profit from that in my

</I>
Event is the easiest part, just send an event at the end of `con_focus
for window, as well as handle_destroy_notify_event,
handle_windowname_change, would suffice.

Renaming would be trickier, that would need a remap of key binding
too, which sounds not so neat. IMO &quot;name&quot; of ws and &quot;caption&quot; or
&quot;title&quot; of ws should be isolated, because mixing ws identifier and
it's display is not a good idea, despite the complexity for the
&quot;ipc-script&quot; to decompose and extract the original ws name, and query
and parse the whole tree, and then remap all the keybindings to this
workspace (would be a nightmare if many bindings refer to it) for each
change.

The thing will be much easier if i3 adds a &quot;caption&quot; property to ws,
so that i3bar and other bars can optionally render it to user, and
this also benefits that renaming a workspace becomes more
straightforward (no longer messing any keybinding). Maybe I'm too used
to tmux.

This is &lt;100 LOC for both i3 and i3bar changes, if this feature is
demanded, I can post my patch for review.
