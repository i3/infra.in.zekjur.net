</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Of course a bar option can be added too to enable/disable this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> feature. Or even give some sophisticated format option for the title,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and also enable user to manually rename it. Would this feature be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> useful?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> To do this we need to add a few new events trigger and maybe a &quot;title&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> field in get_workspace msg. I already have a demo modification for you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to test how it feels, based on master. Now my life with many
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> workspaces is much easier. :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the only modification needed to i3 would be a focus-change-event
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (and maybe with a little hack not even that) and what you want can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entirely done with an ipc-script, no modifications to i3bar necessary.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I would do it like that: Have a daemon running that listens for focus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> events, everytime such an event is triggered, get the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workspaces, find out for each one, what window is currently focused
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (maybe the focus event could include the &#8222;change&#8220;-data which would make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this step unnecessary) and change the title of that workspace to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> title of that window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I said, I think it could also be possible with a little &#8222;hack&#8220;: By
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using the workspace-event you could change the title everytime you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change away from a ws. Then you would have accurately titles for every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ws _not_ currently focused, which should be enough for getting an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overview.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think i3bar is definitely the wrong place to do what you want, though
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is a good idea.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Doing it in i3 (by including an option to change the ws-title to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently focused window) would be better, because then the feature
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be available to users of alternative ws-bars, if they exist. But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this would still be a lot of complexity added to i3 in C for something,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that can be done with IPC and a scripting-language.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Implementing the focus-change-event you should do in any case, imho,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because I ran over a few usecases which would profit from that in my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Event is the easiest part, just send an event at the end of `con_focus
</I>&gt;<i> for window, as well as handle_destroy_notify_event,
</I>&gt;<i> handle_windowname_change, would suffice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Renaming would be trickier, that would need a remap of key binding
</I>&gt;<i> too, which sounds not so neat. IMO &quot;name&quot; of ws and &quot;caption&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;title&quot; of ws should be isolated, because mixing ws identifier and
</I>&gt;<i> it's display is not a good idea, despite the complexity for the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ipc-script&quot; to decompose and extract the original ws name, and query
</I>&gt;<i> and parse the whole tree, and then remap all the keybindings to this
</I>&gt;<i> workspace (would be a nightmare if many bindings refer to it) for each
</I>&gt;<i> change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
actually, you would not need to change your keybinding. you could use 
the i3-command &quot;workspace number &lt;ws-id&gt;&quot; in your config file. Let's 
assume you have workspaces &quot;1: www&quot; and &quot;2: mail&quot;. Then configure your 
workspace switchting keys to the following commands:
	bindsym $mod+$1 workspace number 1: www
	bindsym $mod+$2 workspace number 2: mail

if you now rename the current workspace (e.g. 1: www) with &quot;rename 
workspace to '1: foo'&quot;, you can still access this workspace with your 
configured keybinding.


&gt;<i> The thing will be much easier if i3 adds a &quot;caption&quot; property to ws,
</I>&gt;<i> so that i3bar and other bars can optionally render it to user, and
</I>&gt;<i> this also benefits that renaming a workspace becomes more
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward (no longer messing any keybinding). Maybe I'm too used
</I>&gt;<i> to tmux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is &lt;100 LOC for both i3 and i3bar changes, if this feature is
</I>&gt;<i> demanded, I can post my patch for review.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
