<PRE>Hi,

I've been studying the code-base and started working on ticket #807[0]. 
At the moment I have a working implementation and got acquainted with 
the basics for writing and running tests.

After running the test-suite, to see how much stuff I broke, I got 
several failures; so I reverted my changes, recompiled i3 and re-ran the 
suite just in case. Unfortunately I found out tests were also failing in 
the current master branch.

I'm attaching the complete-run.log in the hope it will help to fix the 
testcases.

BTW I updated the ticket with the patch, comments and suggestions are 
appreciated.
