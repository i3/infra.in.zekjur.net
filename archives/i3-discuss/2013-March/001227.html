<PRE>Hi,

Excerpts from Fam Zheng's message of 2013-03-21 04:16:32 +0100:
&gt;<i> Of course a bar option can be added too to enable/disable this
</I>&gt;<i> feature. Or even give some sophisticated format option for the title,
</I>&gt;<i> and also enable user to manually rename it. Would this feature be
</I>&gt;<i> useful?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To do this we need to add a few new events trigger and maybe a &quot;title&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> field in get_workspace msg. I already have a demo modification for you
</I>&gt;<i> to test how it feels, based on master. Now my life with many
</I>&gt;<i> workspaces is much easier. :)
</I>
I think the only modification needed to i3 would be a focus-change-event
(and maybe with a little hack not even that) and what you want can be
entirely done with an ipc-script, no modifications to i3bar necessary.

So I would do it like that: Have a daemon running that listens for focus
events, everytime such an event is triggered, get the current
workspaces, find out for each one, what window is currently focused
(maybe the focus event could include the &#8222;change&#8220;-data which would make
this step unnecessary) and change the title of that workspace to the
title of that window.

As I said, I think it could also be possible with a little &#8222;hack&#8220;: By
using the workspace-event you could change the title everytime you
change away from a ws. Then you would have accurately titles for every
ws _not_ currently focused, which should be enough for getting an
overview.

I think i3bar is definitely the wrong place to do what you want, though
it is a good idea.
Doing it in i3 (by including an option to change the ws-title to the
currently focused window) would be better, because then the feature
would be available to users of alternative ws-bars, if they exist. But
this would still be a lot of complexity added to i3 in C for something,
that can be done with IPC and a scripting-language.
Implementing the focus-change-event you should do in any case, imho,
because I ran over a few usecases which would profit from that in my
time.


Regards,

Axel
