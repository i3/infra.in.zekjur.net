Subject: [i3] advice on quick manipulation of splits
Message-ID: <878ufgnhyy.fsf@ericabrahamsen.net>

I moved from StumpWM to i3 a bit ago, and everything's basically fine,
ie is a lot faster :)

One usage issue I'm having trouble with:

90% of the time I'm use the tabbed view, no splits, each window taking
up the full screen. Occasionally, though, I want to see windows
side-by-side. In StumpWM I could create and delete splits almost
unconsciously, and I'm not quite getting there with i3.

Mostly because I don't really understand how splits are removed. I often
create them accidentally by hitting mod-h when I meant to hit mod-j. As
far as I can tell, to get rid of that I have to move the window I'm in
down with mod-shift-k, then back up with mod-shift-l, and that removes
the split.

But I just intentionally created a split so that I could see two of my
three Emacs windows side-by-side. When I was done with that, I moved
window three back into the same split as the other two (so now all three
are tabbed in one split), but can't get rid of the split itself. Now
I've got this:

i3: T[emacs emacs emacs]

And below that three tabbed windows. How do I get rid of that top split?

I'm sure this is something very simple and obvious, but I've been poking
at it for a while, and can't figure it out...

Thanks,
Eric

On a whim I selected the parent, and hit mod-e. That removed the split,
but I have *no* idea why. I suspect it's the "Implicit containers"
section of the user guide that I'm not grokking. But I'm really not
grokking it...

Whoa, that was helpful. Thank you!

I'm experimenting now, and think I'm close to getting it.

One note, which might be close to a bug report. My interpretation of my
last issue (where there was a horizontal split I couldn't get rid of) is
this: in horiz/vert split situations, an empty split will disappear --
as the video notes, that's how you "get rid of" split levels. What I
think I was seeing, though, was that if the layout was in tabbed mode,
the empty split didn't actually disappear. It only disappeared when I
hit mod-e to change the layout to horiz/vert.

If that's actually what I was seeing, doesn't that seem a bit wrong?
Shouldn't an empty split disappear no matter what layout mode it's in?

Anyway, my apologies if (as is likely) I'm still misinterpreting
something.

Thanks,
Eric

If I'm understanding you correctly (I may not be :P ), what you're seeing isn't
really an "empty split:" when an existing tab in a container container is split
into a new layout, a new container is nested within it. That container is the
child of the tabbed container it rests in, and is the parent of any windows you
open within it. That nested container remains where it is until you take some
action that removes it, such as changing the layout of the nested container's
parent or moving the only open window in the nested container to a different
container or just plain closing the window. i3 layouts adapt in different ways
depending on the series of actions the *user* takes on individual windows and
groups of windows; you'd have to have taken some action to do away with that
nested container.

My advice for getting a grasp on how i3 works is to use nested containers as
rarely as possible, at least from the start. This keeps things managable---it
avoids situations in which you end up with windows nested so deeply in a layout
that doing anything to one window has effects on all of them. I tend to work
using two or three top-level containers per workspace, and set those containers'
internal layouts based on my needs.  For example, as I write this I'm taking a
break from a research project, and my layout looks like this:

1) One stacked container on the left half of the screen, containing a web browser and
PDF reader

2) One container on the right half, containing only a Vim session with my notes
and taking up about 70% vertical space

3) One tabbed container on the right half below the Vim window, containing a
shell instance, file manager and music player, taking up the remaining ~30% of
vertical space

Arranged in that way, with six windows spread across three top-level containers,
I can move, resize or close any one window, and while the parent containers
would change size with the windows, the container properties would otherwise be
unchanged. I could acheive the same thing by creating a series of splits, but I
don't like mucking around with branch after branch in a complex data tree. I simply
prefer to work at the container level, but I think if you wade into the shallow end
of basic container management like this you can get a feel for how i3 handles
windows before heading into the deep end. ;)

That's really great, thanks.  I think this solved what I want.  This leaves
me with only a small question that I've half-answered below.

So I say this in my config:

bindsym $mod+Tab mode "I3"

mode "I3" {
    # start a terminal
    bindsym c exec urxvt

    ...
    bindsym Escape mode "default"
}

And now I can type "$mod+Tab c" to open a new terminal, "$mod-Tab f" to go
full screen, etc.  And, meanwhile, $mod-f does what I expect it to in emacs
and bash, which is to go forward one word.

One curiosity is that my I3 mode is, well, modal.  Sometimes I suppose this
makes sense, if I'm going to issue quite a lot of commands to the window
manager.  (This is the case with resize mode.)  But It would be nice to
have a transient mode where any command within the mode is executed and
then causes the mode to exit.  Is that possible?

Let me half answer that question.  I've discovered it's possible if I ask
for it with each command:

    bindsym f fullscreen; mode "default"

But it would be cool to be able to specify this about the mode rather than
have to repeat myself throughout the mode's bindings.

bindsym $mod+Tab transientmode "I3"

And this is what we recommend. Using modes this way is an edge case,
and the config file should not get any more complex to support such
edge cases. If you really feel strongly about this, you’re free to
implement a preprocessor for your config file. See also
https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1367/anyway-to-include-in-config-file/ —
in general we want to keep complex features out of the config file.

Message-ID: <CAM4Y7zyrSWW6WCGWd=1zRL97aOzjBNs1sgYUpn62QEFWtNhy=A@mail.gmail.com>

On my laptop I find it quite nice that workspaces are bound to monitors
(outputs).  My monitors have different sizes and often (presentations)
different uses.

On my desktop, I typically pair workspaces, and if I change the left one,
I'm about to change the right one.

Does i3 have native support for this?  (I don't see it?)  Or should I write
a script that does both changes for me (not hard)?  Or is there a better
way?

Thanks.

There's another way: fake-outputs!

https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1659/force-one-i3-instanceworkspace-across-multiple-monitors/

It's not supported nor recommended by Michael and therefore goes 
unmentioned in the docs (it only exists for the testsuite), but I 
happily use it with a 3 monitor setup without issues. Your mileage may 
vary of course, and Michael mentions possible shortcomings in this thread:

Thanks, Marco.  I had found that discussion before asking my question, in
fact.  It's not quite the direction I want to go.

I now have this working.  I do

bindsym Shift+w  mode "workspace"

and then

mode "workspace" {
    # Switch to workspace.
    # This depends on my having set up odd workspaces on the left monitor
    # and even workspaces on the right monitor.
    bindsym a  workspace 1; workspace 2;  mode "default"
    bindsym b  workspace 3; workspace 4;  mode "default"
    bindsym c  workspace 5; workspace 6;  mode "default"
    bindsym d  workspace 7; workspace 8;  mode "default"
    bindsym e  workspace 9; workspace 10; mode "default"
}

(Interestingly, "W" does not work on bindsym while "Shift+w" does.)

You could just as well bind them all to $mod+<number key> to get the same
effect.[1] If you're comfortable with the mode then that's cool, but using a mode
to switch workspaces seems weird to me. :P

Hi everyone! I'm new on i3 and I'm having some problems with some
attributes in i3 bar config file. For example the volume section doesn't
appear, even if I've put it in the config file. Also, some attributes like
status_chr of battery section make my bar having an error and not showing.
Can someone help me please?

Hi you could check the documentation of i3status to see if it's there
any problem check with the default options of i3[1] also to help you,
you need to be more specific or visit[2].

My first guess would be that the version of i3status you are having is too old.

Thank you for answers! I've check my version and it is the last one. I'll
try to be more precise: I want to put in the i3bar icons that tell when the
battery is charging or not for example. If in the battery section of the
i3status.conf file I put status_chr for example, if I restart i3 this
message appears: "Error: status_command process exited unexpectedly (exit
1)". That's it :)

Please avoid using the digest mailing list feature, as it breaks
threading, which is annoying for people who are trying to help you.

Also, when talking about versions of software, _always_ include the
copy&pasted output of what the program says, never say “latest”
because that can mean a number of things (latest version available in
your distribution, latest version announced on the website, latest
version available in git, latest version in a specific branch…).

status_chr has been introduced relatively recently and is not in any
released version. I still think your version is not recent enough.

Subject: [i3] Thoughts on window sizing from a new(-ish) user
Message-ID: <CAM4Y7zwX4UiiXMJFXXXne-W6wjHJ=YxcG-gd04O8ryoiatGR6g@mail.gmail.com>

I've been using i3 for several weeks now on most of my machines [1].  It's
very nice, many thanks to all who have made it work so well.

I find one concept confusingly conflated, and I am curious how others see
it, and if I am simply missing some bit of mental model.  It often happens
that I open several windows, adjust their sizes (for example, some
monitoring plots wide and short, an editor tall, etc.  But if I open a new
window, it changes the sizes I've set. To get around this, I typically set
up windows as I'd like them, then change each window in turn between
vertical and horizontal mode to force creation of a new container, then put
the window into tabbed mode so that new windows don't change its size. (If
all windows are in tabbed mode, then new windows don't cause resizes.)
This achieves what I want, but seems a bit long-winded.

To my mind, this arises because i3 conflates frames with windows.  A frame
is the thing that partitions screen space.  In a frame I can put one or
more windows.  Of course, each frame might have precisely one window, the
current behaviour.  But what I am doing is essentially creating frames and
then expecting new windows to conform to those frames.

Anyway, I'm curious how others see this.

Hi Jeff,
I think what you need is the concept of a container (what you call a
frame). You can create a container before you create a window, e.g.,
mod-H or mod-V for horizontal or vertical splits, and then add the
window in there. The creation of the container is silent until you
actually place a new window in it, but when you do that the new window
only resizes those that already exist in the container, without
affecting size or position of other containers.. I think this is
explained in one of the videos.

Best,
S

Hi, Stefano.

I am using containers, I'm just asking the question if this is optimal (or
if I'm missing something).

You say I can create a container before I create a window.  Really?
Imagine my screen is empty.  I'd like two side-by-side windows in their own
containers, each container tabbed.  I think what I need to do is this:

mod-H   # probably no-op most or all of the time
mod-enter
mod-enter
# now I have my two windows
mod-V
mod-W
# switch to other window
mod-V
mod-W

In other words, I triggered container creation by changing split
orientation.  If I just used mod-W, I'd put the two windows in two tabs in
the same container.

Meanwhile, if I for some reason focus the container and then create or move
in another window, I'll change window sizes.  Bu to my mind creating a new
window is different than creating a new frame.

Technically, maybe, but by all appearances, no. The container doesn't really
seem to exist until the window occupies it. However, any time you create a split
of some sort i3 will be primed to draw a container to the right of or below the
newly split window and open a window within it.

I typically work with two or three separate containers per workspace, usually
starting out stacked and changing the layout in each as necessary. Give this a
try: 

1. Open up your configuration file and add (or change) the setting
   'workspace_layout tabbed'

2. Reload, then start with an empty workspace.

3. *Do not* hit mod-H, and instead just open two terminal windows. They'll be
   tabbed in a single container by default.

4. Now move one of them left or right, thereby moving it into its own container,
   and start playing around. You should get a feel for how things are working
   pretty quickly. Once you do, you can move into other realms.

I just made a script to switch workspaces in i3 in the manner of xmonad.

Normally with i3, each workspace lives on a specific output. When
switching to a workspace, the workspace will show on its assigned
output, regardless of which output has focus.

With xmonad, the output with focus will switch to the requested
workspace. If the requested workspace was already showing on another
output, then the other output and focused output will swap their
workspaces.

Please refer here for more information:

Any feedback would be appreciated!

(Also, I have not tested this on more than two monitors, and would

Subject: [i3] Split-Views in Tabs: Display Window Titles, not process name
Message-ID: <CACaqnaSuYYa0-huAGRaSrvf5oGs3Ne=AMGvSZR+=cAtD9axDmg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I've been using i3wm for a little over a year.  Recently I've been using
the Tabs feature, grouping several terminal windows in different tabs
(monitoring a dozen or so logs).  I have my .bash environment set the
Window Title properly for terminals, and that works with single tabs -
displaying the gnome-terminal's title in the Tab's title just like it
should.

"Single Tabs" meaning with only 1 process running within that tab, i3wm
shows the Window Title of that one process.  E.g. my gnome-terminal's
window title.

This message is about tabs that have multiple processes running within the
tab's i3wm container.  E.g. two or more terminal windows.  i3wm currently
displays in the window title of the tab:

    i3: H[gnome-terminal gnome-terminal]

It is obviously showing the process name, and that I am split via Height.
Cool, but I am missing the Window Title I have set in the terminals.
Again, the Tab's Window Title normally displays the Window Title of the
executing process.  It's when grouping multiple processes within a single
tab.

I think the "H" and "V" is fine. I get things like this:

    i3: H[V[gnome-terminal gnome-terminal] V[gnome-terminal gnome-terminal]]

That obviously says I have a 2x2 arrangement in that tab.  It would really
nice if it showed the Window Title of those processes though.  For example,
if the terminal has the current path set for Window Title, it would look
like:

    i3: H[V["~/code/sp-validator" "~/code/sp-juke"] V["~/go/src/
github.com/eduncan911/go-mspec" "~/"]]

Now, you'll notice I put in quotations. An additional tweak may be to put
in some type of delimier for when titles have spaces - so we know the
different in a title like this:

    i3: H[Evolution Inbox ~/code/sp-validator:grep]

^- That's two different apps running in horizonal split view.  Without
quotes around "Evolution Inbox", it would hard to determine where the first
one ends and second begins.

Just a suggestion to an awesome window manager!

Thanks!
Eric

As a side note if you're a py3status user or want to give it a try, one
of the features of the *xrandr* module [1] allows you to automatically
move a workspace to an output when it's activated.

If I'm not mistaken, that's the behavior you were after.
Quick doc abstract :

This modules allows you to handle your screens outputs directly from your bar!
    - Detect and propose every possible screen combinations
    - Switch between combinations using click events and mouse scroll
    - Activate the screen or screen combination on a single click
    - It will detect any newly connected or removed screen automatically

For convenience, this module also proposes some added features:
    - Dynamic parameters for POSITION and WORKSPACES assignment (see below)
    - Automatic fallback to a given screen or screen combination when no more
        screen is available (handy for laptops)
    - Automatically apply this screen combination on start: no need for xorg!
    - Automatically move workspaces to screens when they are available


Maybe it can be of interest to someone, cheers.

I too use a laptop and move between 3 different environments with 3
different monitor setups (@ home has 3 external monitors, @ work has 2
external + laptop's LCD, and @ work2 has 1 large monitor + laptop's LCD).

I too was frustrated with managing environments every time I disconnect and
move to another location (@ work with a nice arrangement, on train with
only built-in LCD, back at home to continue working... argh, have to
rearrange everything).

What I ended up doing was binding a few keys to "move the entire workspace
from one monitor to another monitor", keeping the exact arrangement:

https://github.com/eduncan911/env-scripts/blob/master/.i3/config#L204-L208

^- see highlighted lines starting with "bindsym $mod+Control+Shift+Left
move workspace to output left"

Technically, what you want is easily achieved. The relevant code is
con_get_tree_representation() in src/con.c.

However, I’m not convinced using the window titles makes sense. Titles
very quickly exceed the screen space you have in a tabbed container,
so keeping the description as short as possible makes it more useful.

Personally, I am typically interested in the full window titles, which
is why I use stacked mode instead of tabbed mode.

Subject: [i3] Efficiently setting up screen layout
Message-ID: <CAM4Y7zw_MjVpB0jQ_Wqae_LPU5nPXQ7GcehDy3bw-Aav5fY5jA@mail.gmail.com>

I often want a layout in which I have two windows side by side, and under
one of those windows I have one or two small windows.  I have

workspace_layout tabbed

set in my config.  Each time I want to set this up, I do the following:

create window
create window
move right
focus parent
split v
create    *(lower is focused)*
split h    *(just to create new node)*
layout tabbed

And so now I have three windows frames showing and each is in tabbed mode
so that new windows won't change the layout on me.  Great!

But this feels cumbersome, so I'd like to automate it, but I think any
automation is timing-dependent, since windows have to map in each step
before the next.

I'm I missing something?

Message-ID: <1427217979.889630.244653742.7445CAC4@webmail.messagingengine.com>

I'm kinda new to Linux in general, and now I'm learning how to use Arch
Linux. I installed i3 today and it's a very fun window manager. But I'm
having some problems using it.

1) When I use Mod4+a, the Parent Container is selected, and then I press
it again and again and everything gets selected. How do I deselect
everything and return to my previous window selection (right now I can
only do that by creating a new window or changing workspace)?

2) When I run startx, two terminal windows are automatically loaded into
my screen. I looked into /etc/i3/config and ~/.i3/config and there's no
"exec" there. I can't find a way to disable this and get a clean start.

Sorry if these things are easy to fix, but I couldn't find it anywhere.
Thanks.

1.  Mod-d (for down)

2.  Strange.  Do you have an ~/.xsessionrc?  See man xsession for too much

Look also in the following files:
~/.xinitrc              if it exists
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc  otherwise
