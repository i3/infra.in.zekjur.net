<PRE>Hi ian,

Excerpts from ian's message of 2011-11-14 19:37:14 +0000:
&gt;<i> is not a problem, I am just asking what is the point of startup
</I>&gt;<i> notification on a wm who's target audience are advanced users and
</I>&gt;<i> developers, fine in KDE or Gnome.
</I>I thought quoting the release notes is sufficient to answer that question. Let
me first quote again, then elaborate:

i3 now supports startup notifications, meaning that during an application
starts up, the mouse cursor will change to 'watch' on the root window. Also,
the application window will appear on the workspace on which it was launched
(not on the currently focused workspace). Some applications don&#8217;t support
startup notifications. If the cursor change bothers you, turn it off by using
the --no-startup-id flag (see the userguide).

This means two things:
1) We solve the following long-standing bug:
   Start something, switch to a different workspace, the window opens on the
   new workspace instead of where you intended it to be.
2) We display a progress indicator. This is important (and especially so when
   using dmenu, our current recommendation, with its poor feedback) to know
   that your computer is actually doing something (starting an application).
   It is one step closer to making the user being in control, not wondering
   what is currently going on. Previously, you just pressed some key and
   *hoped* that a window would show up soon. Progress indication and
   acknowledgement of user input are fundamental things in good user
   interfaces.

Best regards,
Michael
</PRE>
