Subject: [i3] Querying Current Workspace / Window
Message-ID: <1277943868.18659.1382732975@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Is there an easy(ish) way find out the number of the currently focussed
workspace from the command line?


I have the excellent BBC iPlayer running away on another workspace.
Occasionally I want to pause for a phone call etc. and then unpause.
Unfortunately as the iPlayer makes use of embedded flash, I can't bind
directly to a shortcut key.


What I'm doing instead is using a combination of i3-msg and xdotool to
flip to the correct workspace and mouseclick at the appropriate point. I
stick this in a shell script, and then exec the script on a bindsym.


My script looks like this:


#!/bin/bash

# set focus to iplayer desktop
i3-msg 4

#
# Move to player and ensure focus is on embedded player
#
xdotool mousemove 1465 430
xdotool click 1

#
# Now move and click play / pause
#
xdotool mousemove 1465 487
xdotool click 1



So far, so trivial, and it works a treat.


But I'd like to be able to record which i3 workspace I'm on, flip and
click, and then restore. I don't much care about the screen flickering
etc.


Any way I can achieve that, or do I need to fiddle with talking to the
socket directly?

Yes, using AnyEvent::I3, this is pretty simple:

perl -MList::Util -MAnyEvent::I3 \
     -E 'my @ws = @{i3->get_workspaces->recv};
     my $focused = List::Util::first { $_->{focused} } @ws;
     say $focused->{num}'

Subject: [i3] Behaviour of "Mark" and "Goto"
Message-ID: <1277976240.30076.1382788255@webmail.messagingengine.com>

A bit of a follow on from my previous question.


(Apologies for starting a new thread, but for some reason I'm not
getting email to reply to, including my original post)


I thought a slightly different tack might be better, if I used the
"mark" and "goto" functions to "mark" my current position with a fixed
identifier and the "goto" once I've performed my play / pause on the
target workspace.


However I'm seeing strange behaviour when I use the same feature from a
couple of bindsym entries.


bindsym Mod4+M goto mydestination
bindsym Mod4+N mark mydestination


If I try to flip around using these binds, the tabs aren't refreshed
correctly and i3 seems confused


As an example, I:


Mod4+1 to flip to the first workspace
Mod4+N to mark this as a destination
Mod4+4 to flip to the fourth workspace
Mod4+M to goto destination


The tabs at the top of workspace 1 are now replaced by the tabs I had at
workspace 4

If I flip between the workspaces and click on the tab area, eventually
they sort themselves out, but not before the contents of workspace 4
seem to have replaced workspace 1 (they haven't permanently, eventually
it sorts itself out)

 
i3 -v yields:

i3 version 3.e (2010-03-30) ? 2009-2010


I'm on Ubuntu 10.04, single monitor.

At the moment, there is no way to have windows appear on more than one
workspace.

Subject: [i3] Status line and system tray
Message-ID: <4C4E80B0.8020602@ganomi.com>

Hi.

I have got few comments in regards to status line and system tray.

System tray
========
Missing system tray in status line is a problem. Today we have got 
several apps having system tray icon. Having separate system tray panel 
(stalonetray) is wasting of space.
I prefer i3 from Awesome WM (AWM), because of the the way how i3 handles 
the tiles, however AWM has got system tray in the panel, which is good 
idea and I am missing this in i3.

Status Line and bzen2
===============
You advise to use bzen2 as a status line. I understand that you do not 
want to reinvent a wheel, however bzen2 does not adjust to the screen 
size if you have notebook and keep switching screens from one to 
another. So, I think that bzen2 is not good solution.

Also why to have i3 status line with only workspaces? This is again 
wasting of space. I would say that clock, system tray should be included.
bzen2 only if you need additional info.


Today, we have to think about notebooks and dynamic changes. Anything 
static is way to hell.

Do you plan any changes/enhancements to this?

Send patches. I have no need at all for a system tray.

Did you read http://i3.zekjur.net/docs/wsbar.html? It explains that you can use
i3-wsbar to have the dzen2 instances adjust to your different screens and
display a workspace bar line in the same dzen2 that you use for i3status (or
other status programs).

Best regards,
Michael

Hi Michael.

Sorry, I am not developer. I just made a suggestion. I understand that 
you may not need it. I need it primarily for Skype. I am trying to say 
that it would not have to be bad to have it there.

# i3-wsbar -c "dzen2 -fg white -fn 
'-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso8859-1' -ta r"|
I tried, but I get only black top bar. Also if I open terminal on new 
workspace, the window top panel will hide it.



# i3status | dzen2 -fg white -fn 
'-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso8859-1' -ta r
works but then I have issues if I switch screens.

Thanks for hints.

You want the "-dock" option for dzen2 (a svn version of dzen2 is
needed for this)

Sure, I know that some people would use a tray. There also is a ticket in our
bugtracker for that. It?s just that other things have more priority for me
(developing the tree branch).

A friend of mine is writing tbar, and he wants to add tray support. With
this you can add this bar with additional informations like clock and
have space for trayicons.
I know a builtin bar in i3 would be nice, but as Michael said, that has
not the highest priority.
But when i got time, i will see if i can code something to add this
functionality, so be patient :)

bmpanel2 does the job. It gives you the oportunity to use the systemtray.

But if you use skype, there is no need for the systemtray. If you close accidently the main window, just type skype & in a terminal, 
and the mainwindow is open again. That works with the most programs, who are minimized to a system tray.
 
Have fun,

Hi.

I will try the bmpanel2.

I just found out that I can run the stalonetray as follows and it will 
display just the icons. Not the whole panel.
# stalonetray -bg black -i 16 --window-type toolbar
(I only need to find out how to place it in the right top/bottom corner)
That way it stays on the top of the i3 panel and does not take 
additional space.

I need Skype system tray for one reason - you can see if you have missed 
calls or messages on all screens.

Thanks for the tips!

Subject: [i3] Container Suggestions
Message-ID: <AANLkTinJ5QZ6QyEb=Ei=EVRBya0YoMqxCRrobOYwqhKX@mail.gmail.com>

Archlinux newbie here - after going on a spree trying out several different
tiling window managers, I decided I like i3 best, it seems the least
restrictive. Bug #164 gets me quite a bit, but it's no biggie.

I think the movement and resizing of clients & containers could be made more
intuitive. If it were up to me, I'd make it work like this:

  1- Starting a new program would always put that new client into its own
new container, by itself. Or make that an option in the config, and set
exceptions for specific clients.

  2- I'd set containers as "stacking" or "tiling" in the default config. The
"default" container mode seems to have little purpose as far as I can tell,
and makes it very difficult to identify what is and isn't a container
(resizeable) border.

  3- I'd rename the keybinds in some way / change user guide to encourage
the use of "move container" primarily over the use of "move client," so the
latter is only used exclusively for stacking & unstacking clients.

  4- If 4 clients form a + intersection of borders, clicking near the +
would allow you to resize all 4 windows at once, and there would be special
keybinds for this too. Normal resize keybinds would resize only two of the
clients, not all 4, and doing this near the + intersection would snap it on
& off.

  5- Ability to change the pixel-size of window borders. Larger borders are
easier to see and click on at very high resolutions, or with poor mice.

  6- Ability to bind modifiers+mouse buttons to different things. Another WM
had this, and I really liked it. This seems like something that might
already be in there but I just couldn't find?

Being Linux, I guess should just learn to program and do these things
myself. :) Which I might do someday.
Thanks for the window manager!

If you mean when it?s ready to use, I cannot give you an appropriate estimate
time, unfortunately. I am sometimes using it for day-to-day-work and it
basically works, but a lot of stuff is still missing.

Best regards,
Michael

Hi David

I downloaded and compiled the svn version of dzen2.

dzen2 will load as a dock now, but I am not able to see the time, 
network details, etc., as I was able with the Debian package. Is this 
expected behavior?

Thanks!

You need to use i3-status with a pipe:

i3status | dzen2 -y 882  -ta r  -x 500 &   (I have this line in my
~/.i3/config file)

If you use arch linux, you have to make a few changes in ~/.i3status.conf

like http://joac.pastebin.com/3LkFiMy9

happy i3ing

Hi Michael.

I tested the above with the following results

# exec i3status | i3-wsbar -c "dzen2 -fg white -ta r -dock"
As the panel appears at the top of the screen, all new windows are 
opened over that bar. I am not sure if this is a bug.

# exec i3status | i3-wsbar -c "dzen2 -x %x -dock"
This works, however the panel is located at the bottom.
