Well, about vim, I have the same feeling. I'm quite happy to read 
someone saying that vim does too many things.
Now, I really would like a text editor... no, a code editor with the 
same philosophy (ESPECIALLY for configuration btw!) as i3, but there are 
some issues I guess.
For example, accessing a file from multiple instances of the editor, 
which is quite common in an IDE (at least, open that file in multiple 
tabs) will probably pulls problems when we spoke about syncing the 
changes.
The only solution I can think to solve it is the mpd way: a daemon to 
handle a particular file, and clients just connect to that daemon, so 
the sync problem can be managed.
But you have to think about one fact, when you speak about vim 
reimplementing a wm (which is true, sadly): it was written in 1991, as a 
console application. I am not sure how gnu screen or other text window 
managers were at that time?

There is another problem which make me thinking that an i3 environment 
is not completely usable as an IDE: a multiple window application can't 
ask the wm to place windows in a specific scheme, in the space the wm 
would have allocated to it.
However, in the next version of i3, there will be layouts, so this 
might be worked around.

By the way, I have to admit that several years ago, I was not able to 
admit that it was possible to program without a real IDE (and someone 
mentioned me cube as a counter-example, but I never checked if it was 
really written without an IDE, which would anyway not be provable), now 
I have even removed any file manager from my system.
Many thanks to i3 developers, which have reduced a lot the pain of 
using computers for me. Sadly, now when people take a look at my 
screens, they see me like if I am some kind of E.T. ...

I'm even thinking that it would be very nice to build a DE based on a 
tiling wm, plus softwares which are twm friendly... but I do not think I 
master the thing enough for now, I still have a lot to learn, and trying 
to create a meta-package for that is... well, it made me think a lot 
about what, exactly, would be a minimal DE, since it would be damn 
stupid to reproduce the errors other DEs have, imho, done (I will never 
understand why DEs' meta-packages have hard-dependencies on softwares, 
instead of simply recommending them).

I am also very annoyed by this behavior of vim (and other things) but
I have good hope in the neovim project which intends to solve most of
vim's shortages (www.neovim.org).

As for firefox, you can configure it so that it doesn't tabs.

Near as I can tell, this is enabled when Vim is built with a "normal" or "huge"
feature set, as it is in most Linux and BSD distributions. Here's a blog post on some
basic usage:

How does this work with that feature that makes sure Fx only loads
activated tabs on start? I.e. if you start Fx, it will load the page
in the tab you're in when starting. Then whenever you happen to visit
a tab, it will load the page in it. Without this behaviour, Fx would
be unpleasant at best to use for me. I probably have around 1000 tabs
open in 5 instances of Fx or so.

Subject: [i3] window focus with pidgin-im
Message-ID: <53C54BA6.5090208@mehrzweckraum.com>

hi..

new i3 user here, first journey into tiling country. i guess 
single-tiled MS-DOS back then doesnt count. ;)

currently running i3 on a manjaro-netbook (my testing enviroment) and a 
xubuntu-thinkpad with second screen attached which is the work machine.
for a newbie some things are weird, but i like how i3 works.

the app i am currently struggling the most is pidgin.

when pidgin is set to using it's own tabbed interface then only the 
first chat makes i3 shift focus to that window. any subsequent chat 
doesnt. which in turn leads to new chats in auto-opened mode do not get 
raised to attention.
if there are any hints how i can help to catch that secret signal pidgin 
might be sending or not, i am happy to follow along.

another issue is that if i dont use pidgin-tabs but let i3 resolve that, 
a new chat window will get immediate attention, no matter where i am 
else. which is actually worse than no attention, because this will have 
me typing any wild commands into a chat and very likely hitting enter..

from my ~/.i3/config

for_window [class="Pidgin"] floating enable, move container to workspace 1


grateful for any hints,
cheers,
grubernd

I use the "message notification" plugin (comes per default, I think) and
have it configured to set the URGENT hint. This will highlight the
chatwindow (and the workspace it's on in i3bar) whenever you get a new
message.

Best,

hi..

xubuntu 13.04 raring is my base-system.
currently from the official repos i have i3 4.2 installed.
trying to upgrade to a newer version with the commands from the help 
page, yields various errors i cannot get past.

http://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html

in the end it boils down to this one:

 > The following packages have been kept back:
 >  i3 i3-wm

neither apt-get update, nor with --fix-missing nor any other googly 
answer i found related to this worked.

and the visual update-manager refuses to upgrade from un-authenticated 
sources.

any hints how i can get a better i3?

thanks in advance,
grubernd

To me, the Ubuntu repos are usually PITA.

I am building it myself, really easier to manage.

might try that. not much of a self-compiler, though.

Why is the source unauthenticated? Did you not follow the instructions

The arch suggestion is a good one, I use i3 on arch and it is awesome and
yes an alternative to Arch el natural is Manjaro.

That should not matter.

What’s the output of “apt-get install i3-wm i3”? Also, what’s the output
of “apt-get install i3-wm=4.8-1raring1”?

i didnt drop it, thunderbird did. ;)

which is weird, because on some other lists it rather keeps the address 
of the sender besides the list-address. maybe because you are the admin 
there is something different in your reply-to settings?
i had to add i3-discuss manually now. my replies to other list-members 
before worked, as expected.

the output is the same, see below. i tried various things like adding a 
nameserver to the resolv.conf but to be honest: i dont have a clue how 
that ubuntu-package-server thingie really works, couldnt find any 
instructions free of myths or wild speculations. it's supposed to be 
automatic, isnt it? ;)

That’s odd. Your system seems to be lacking the signing keys for the
Ubuntu package sources. In addition (perhaps caused by that), your
package lists seem outdated (which is why you get the 404s). I’d suggest
deleting /var/lib/apt/lists/*, followed by apt-get update. If apt-get
update complains, fix the signature problem. Get help about how to do
that elsewhere please since that’s not an i3 problem.

Afterwards, it should just work.

a follow-up. apparently x/ubuntu 13.04 has really reached its EOL (end 
of life) and the servers for raring were taken offline in austria. well.

after almost three hours munching through more than 2k packages for the 
dist-upgrade to 14.04 LTS everything is up and running, including i3 4.8.

maybe using ubuntu raring (13.04) isnt the ideal choice for the 
development version anymore - unless the website is outdated:
http://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html

 > Development versions are only available for the latest version of 
Ubuntu, which is raring at the moment.

because that line was the reason i thought the update inside 13.04 would 
work in the first place.

Updated it. Ubuntu releases too often, it’s impossible to keep up :p.

Note that the version you are using is _not_ the development
version. You’re installing stable. Not sure why you read a paragraph
about the development version and then deduce anything related to stable
from that :).

As you can see in the Debian bug tracker, there are no known bugs with
the version packaged for Debian. Also note that we have 4.8 in Debian,
while you are using Ubuntu.

Please don’t try to get support by directly mailing random maintainers.
I’ve cc'ed i3-discuss@ which is the appropriate place to ask questions.

If you have a reproducible bug, the appropriate place to report it is

In Debian stable there is 4.2, but I'm using backported 4.7.2. Will 4.8
be available in backports repository?

Subject: [i3] Multidimensional spatial tiling
Message-ID: <20140729121718.GP15171@cardamom.adamsinfoserv.com>

I've been able to port over my workspace management from Awesome to i3
using IPC, the config is attached.

The concept was discussed frequently on IRC. Imagine instead of using
workspaces as tags, they are just elements in an array. If you
represent a workspace as a cell on a piece of graph paper, and then
use another piece of paper with one or more cells cut out as a mask to
slide around and view the underlying layer it would be a fair analogy.

Down to the issue I've found. I'm not sure if I'm outracing the IPC
interface, but frequently IPC commands to make the workspaces change
are failing while returning success. So I'll have a monitor where the
workspace is still a scratch one (ie: by output name) instead of it
changing to the workspace intended. No crashing, and often repeating
the operation will make it work.

Second I've run into an issue where Gkrellm cannot dock on the left or
right side of the screen because left/right docking WM hints haven't
been implemented yet. Is this a pending feature?

Thanks.

i know i am using stable right now. but since i am not too scared about 
running one or the other app in their dev-version even on my production 
machine i thought i'd try that since the last version for ubuntu 13.04 
was 4.2.
once i have i3 figured out better i might move to the dev-releases, a 
man needs a hobby.

anyway.. after fixing some ubuntu upgrade stuff everything looks pretty 
pretty now.

cheers,

Subject: [i3] Lowest empty Workspace
Message-ID: <53D7DD87.8030107@stranner.org>

I want to switch to the lowest workspace that doesn't have any windows on it quite often. Because I use multiple monitors it is not always obvious and quick to see which workspaces are currently in use. So i wrote a little script that switches (or moves a window) to the lowest empty workspace.

#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..100}
do
	res=$(i3-save-tree --workspace $i | grep -v "^//")
	if [ -z "$res" ]; then
		if [ $1 = "m" ]; then
			i3-msg move workspace $i
		fi
		if [ $1 = "n" ]; then
			i3-msg workspace $i
		fi
		break
	fi
done

It works pretty well but is kinda hackish and could be faster. I am not aware of any native support for this use case. Does anyone know about a better way of addressing this use case?

Thanks.

You're very welcome.  Might I also suggest you take a look at my pending 
pull request, which adds support to jump directly to the first window 
(in any workspace) whose urgency hint is set.  I find this incredibly 
useful.

Once you get this stabilized, may I ask you to contribute this
configuration to the “user-contributed documentation” section on
i3wm.org?

Sounds like a race condition. The i3 logfile will be helpful, see
http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html

Ugh, why do you re-implement all the IPC interface code? There’s
libraries for that :). I hear https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python is
the most maintained and up to date one.

I just uploaded 4.8 to wheezy-backports. It should be available within a
couple of hours.

I would encourage it to be shared. Whether I can write some form of
contribution may vary, time permitting. I'm certainly a strong
advocate of virtual screen space over tagging.

I will give that a try!

That's a shame that it seems so difficult. It appears that the docking
support was hardcoded with only i3bar in mind. I'm trying to use
Gkrellm again, and unfortunately I may have to revert to awesome if I
can't. I am very keen to see this supported. Gkrellm and i3bar provide
completely different functionality and on a tiny laptop I can spare
space on the left due to the wide screen craze. Every line of vertical
space is precious. I'd rather do without i3bar.

I spoke with one of the authors of one of the libraries along the way
too. It's trivial code to create for my use case, and my version of
Ubuntu didn't meet the prerequisites of the best of the Python i3 IPC
libraries. I think autotools was out of date. To sum up: I tried to
use the lib, and wrote a few lines myself instead of upgrading.

Thanks.
