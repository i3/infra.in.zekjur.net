<PRE>Hi.

I have got few comments in regards to status line and system tray.

System tray
========
Missing system tray in status line is a problem. Today we have got 
several apps having system tray icon. Having separate system tray panel 
(stalonetray) is wasting of space.
I prefer i3 from Awesome WM (AWM), because of the the way how i3 handles 
the tiles, however AWM has got system tray in the panel, which is good 
idea and I am missing this in i3.

Status Line and bzen2
===============
You advise to use bzen2 as a status line. I understand that you do not 
want to reinvent a wheel, however bzen2 does not adjust to the screen 
size if you have notebook and keep switching screens from one to 
another. So, I think that bzen2 is not good solution.

Also why to have i3 status line with only workspaces? This is again 
wasting of space. I would say that clock, system tray should be included.
bzen2 only if you need additional info.


Today, we have to think about notebooks and dynamic changes. Anything 
static is way to hell.

Do you plan any changes/enhancements to this?
