<PRE>Archlinux newbie here - after going on a spree trying out several different
tiling window managers, I decided I like i3 best, it seems the least
restrictive. Bug #164 gets me quite a bit, but it's no biggie.

I think the movement and resizing of clients &amp; containers could be made more
intuitive. If it were up to me, I'd make it work like this:

  1- Starting a new program would always put that new client into its own
new container, by itself. Or make that an option in the config, and set
exceptions for specific clients.

  2- I'd set containers as &quot;stacking&quot; or &quot;tiling&quot; in the default config. The
&quot;default&quot; container mode seems to have little purpose as far as I can tell,
and makes it very difficult to identify what is and isn't a container
(resizeable) border.

  3- I'd rename the keybinds in some way / change user guide to encourage
the use of &quot;move container&quot; primarily over the use of &quot;move client,&quot; so the
latter is only used exclusively for stacking &amp; unstacking clients.

  4- If 4 clients form a + intersection of borders, clicking near the +
would allow you to resize all 4 windows at once, and there would be special
keybinds for this too. Normal resize keybinds would resize only two of the
clients, not all 4, and doing this near the + intersection would snap it on
&amp; off.

  5- Ability to change the pixel-size of window borders. Larger borders are
easier to see and click on at very high resolutions, or with poor mice.

  6- Ability to bind modifiers+mouse buttons to different things. Another WM
had this, and I really liked it. This seems like something that might
already be in there but I just couldn't find?

Being Linux, I guess should just learn to program and do these things
myself. :) Which I might do someday.
Thanks for the window manager!
