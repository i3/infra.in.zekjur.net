<PRE>Hello Michael,

thanks for your quick action.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm running a somewhat unusual setup with 3 monitors in pivot mode. Total
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> screen size is 3600x1920, but in order to be able to stretch my IDE across 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> monitors I'm using the fake-outputs option to form just 2 workspaces:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      fake-outputs 1200x1920+0+0,2400x1920+1200+0
</I>
&gt;<i> This is the problem. There is a reason this option is not documented:
</I>&gt;<i> itâ€™s not supported and not intended to be used at all. It exists for
</I>&gt;<i> our testsuite only.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Remove the fake-outputs option and the i3bar configuration will work.
</I>
That's the answer I feared ;)

I understand that this mode is not supported, but besides the i3bar 
glitch it works wonderful with said configuration and provides a great 
deal of flexibility with minimal effort.

As I have a few applications that don't fit into just one workspace, 
having three independent workspaces would complicate application 
switching and especially startup.

I guess the application switching could be solved with some scripting to 
keep workspaces in sync (or is there already support for this?).

But at least Eclipse does not seem to be able restore a window 
configuration that has been split to different workspaces across 
sessions. Hm, maybe I could somehow automate the process of detaching 
and moving the different views as well.

Still, would you be open to receive a patch to make i3bar work?

Anyway, thanks much for your feedback and for supporting a very useful 
piece of software. Have a great weekend.

Cheers,

Marco
