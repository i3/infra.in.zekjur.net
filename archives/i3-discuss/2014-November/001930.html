<PRE>Hi,
I am a new user of i3 and I am really enjoying it. Coming from a
floating setup (XFCE), I can definitely see speedups in my workflow. I
have a couple of questions.

First, the remaining time displayed by i3-status disagrees widely with
that estimated by powertop. It's often 10 or 15 hours, or even more...
I understand that i3-status uses information from the battery (and I
admit not having checked whether the proc info makes sense), but I was
wondering how whether this has been see, and if one could instead use
whatever method powertop uses. Just a suggestion.

The second thing is the battery info color. I wanted to change the
low_threshold but if I add something like low_threshold=30 in the
i3-status config the result is that the color never changes (always
white). If I take it out, I get red on low.

Lastly, my laptop has two batteries. It would be useful if the
estimated time were the total for the two batteries rather than only
for the one currently in use. On second thought, however, I guess
i3-status needs to see the discharge rate to estimate the remaining
time, so this might not be possible without caching discharge rates.
In fact, even powertop reports remaining time based on one battery
only...

Anyway, overall a great piece of software! I had not been so
enthusiastic about the look and feel of my desktop in a long time!

Best,
Stefano
