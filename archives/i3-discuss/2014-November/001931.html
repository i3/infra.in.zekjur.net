<PRE>Hi everyone,
I have tried a couple of simple virtual keyboards, svkbd and xvkbd,
and in both cases when I press a key on the touchscreen or with the
mouse, i3 gives focus to the keyboard window and nothing happens. I
understand that i3 and virtual keyboards are not the most natural
match, but I have a convertible thinkpad that I like to use for
handwriting notes and it would be good to have the possibility of a
virtual keyboard.

I have also tried cellwriter, a handwriting recognition software, and
it does not seem to communicate well with i3... it docks to the very
bottom of the screen obscuring the bar, and i3 does not take it into
account at all, in that it also partly obscures all windows. In other
window managers I tried in the past (I guess XFCE, since I have been
using that for a while), the window manager was able to take into
account that part of the creen was taken by cellwriter and would place
windows as if that part was not available at all (like a panel, so to
speak).

Any help would be appreciated!

S
