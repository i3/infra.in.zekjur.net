<PRE>Hello Michael,

&gt;&gt;<i> May I ask why you are opposed to officially support such configurations? In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the FAQ one can find mention of the &quot;fakeoutputs&quot; option. IMHO the use case
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does not seem entirely esoteric.
</I>
&gt;<i> Well, ideally, things should just work out of the box, and you would
</I>&gt;<i> not need that option at all, right? ;)
</I>
Ideally, yes, but I can't expect that i3 magically knows how I want my 
workspaces configured - maybe in the future ;)


&gt;<i> The problem with fake-outputs is that it (just like Xinerama)
</I>&gt;<i> circumvents RandR support in i3 entirely, meaning i3 will not react to
</I>&gt;<i> disabling outputs (re-assigning workspaces to other outputs) or
</I>&gt;<i> enabling new outputs (such as connecting a video projector). Those are
</I>&gt;<i> significant problems, and I don’t want to support people actively
</I>&gt;<i> breaking important parts of i3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize that one could argue that when people use it, it’s their own
</I>&gt;<i> fault that other features break, but still, it’s not something I want
</I>&gt;<i> to endorse in any way :).
</I>
Understood. I was not aware of the implications. The entries in the FAQ 
I found did not provide any technical background and therefore left me 
wondering.

I certainly agree that the default behavior is reasonable. For my 
specific setup, the &quot;fake-outputs&quot; option is not restricting in any way, 
quite the opposite actually, as I don't have the immediate need to spend 
time and find solutions for usability problems as not all applications 
fit into just one workspace. I might switch to the proper way in the 
future, but for now I'm happy that I could bend i3 to work the way I 
want it to :)

Thanks again for your help. Much appreciated. I really hope i3 survives 
the switch to Wayland in one form or another.

Cheers,

Marco
