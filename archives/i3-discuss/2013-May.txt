Subject: [i3] i3 neo layout messup on arch linux
Message-ID: <98bf4c907b131c7ce24367ddb51573d8@tvk.rwth-aachen.de>

Hi guys,

	I just started using arch linux on my netbook and of course I wanted 
my beloved i3 on it. So after installing the packages and putting an 
"exec i3" in my .xinitrc it works just fine. Also I put an "setxkbmap de 
neo -option" before the "exec i3" in my .xinitrc because I use neo 
layout.
	Now on my fedora desktop I am using neo layout as well and the 
keybindings stay in the same location as in quertz. E.g. Mod+q closes a 
window on neo layout as well (not Mod+p which is q in neo).This is 
different in arch. The "location" changes with the layout.
How can I change that and why is it that way?

Greetings
Lukas

P.S. Sorry for sending two mails. My config was messed up. Couldn't get 
the replies.

Hi Lukas,

See
https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1676/shortcuts-not-working-on-non-english-layouts/

Essentially, either use the keycode-based config file (default) or
delete your config and re-run i3-config-wizard after changing your
layout.

If you use keycodes then the shortcuts are at the same place.

Use full "text keys" in config file and it should be ok.

By "just launching" do you mean adding "exec gnome-settings-daemon" to
.i3/config

The benefits of my changes, versus just the exec:
- Ctrl+Alt+L locks the screen using gnome-screensaver, as opposed to
doing nothing.
- "xprop -root PULSE_SERVER" returns the correct result, as opposed to
nothing at all.

I'm comparing results on my desktop so I can't even comment on
suspend+resume. :/

What is gnome-settings-daemon supposed to do, without all the
surrounding xsession stuff in my patch? (it turns out I don't know a
whole lot about how gnome works)

Yes (with the full path since it?s often outside of $PATH for a good
reason though).

Yeah, you need gnome-session for that. But you can use gnome-session 
locally in an easy way (see below).

This is just a PulseAudio module (see module-x11-publish and pax11publish).

The gnome-settings-daemon contains all the little magic things of GNOME.
The only part left to gnome-session is the? session management (locking, 
presence).


The only real needed part of your patch is the i3.gnome.session file, 
which you can put in the ~/.config/gnome-session/sessions directory.
The "i3-gnome" script is not the good way to do it. Just put the 
dbus-send command in the i3 config file (at the end, a simple "exec").

Regarding the session script ("gnome-session-i3"), just use your 
~/.xinitrc to exec that. :-)

The "i3.applications.desktop" patch is not bad, may be the only thing to 
include upstream, but not sure what are the implications.

Cheers,

Subject: [i3] Containers
Message-ID: <CAAAWjP3aKiNzE7dw-Ra0=oqLcGGX4MSn36uqYDzsD8KBOASdxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm using i3 for 6 months now and I love it. I even made a donation some
time ago.

However, there is a issue bothering me and I would like to know if there is
a solution.

Let's say I open 3 terminal windows:

1) "Alt + Enter" opens the first;
2) "Alt + Enter" opens the second horizontally (default);
3) "Alt + v" and then "Alt + Enter" opens the third vertically;

So until now I have the screen split in 2 columns: in the first column I
have 1 window and in the second column I have 2 windows (1 above the other).

So let's say I select the second opened window and close it. If I switch to
tabbed mode, the third window is placed below/inside another window called
T[urxvt].

I know this occurs because of the containers thing, but I would like to
know if I can have the tabbed mode of without that T[urxvt] window. When I
open and close several windows and change the layout several times, a lot
of these additional windows are opened.

There is a way to solve this?

It doesn't happen for me. Maybe it's a question of i3 version,
or maybe I don't understand what to do to reproduce this behaviour.

Whenever you want to get rid of a split container, you can just move
all of its children out of it. When the last child leaves a container,
the container is destroyed, e.g.:

H[win1 T[win3]] # win3 focussed
move left
H[win1 win3 T[]] # intermediate step; a result of moving win3
H[win1 win3] # the T container get destroyed because it is empty.

This is how I understand it. I hope I was helpful.
If not, feel free to ask for more explanations. 

Best regards.

Hi,

There is also http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWA8Pl57UBY which helps
