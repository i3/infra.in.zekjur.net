Yes, it did read that way, pretty clearly. It's good that you realized
it yourself and sent the above.

While I think you are correct that it's unintended behavior -- a bug
-- but not important functionally, I think Michael's response is
perfectly reasonable, as the developer of good software for which we
must all remember he is giving us free of charge. I don't know
Michael, but I have seen indications that he's a busy guy. As someone
who had a 45-year career in software development, I can tell you that
just continuing development of i3 and providing the level of support
he does is a big job. And that's in addition to whatever he does to
earn his living and have a life. So, without trying to speak for him,
I'm guessing his response came from that perspective. It was also a
bit like the old joke about he fellow who says to the doctor &quot;Doctor,
when I do this, it hurts&quot;. To which the doctor responded &quot;Don't do
that&quot;.

I would also add that we are living in an open source world. Part of
the point of open source is that we can all contribute to the
development of a piece of software. Read or listen to any of Richard
Stallman's descriptions of his issue with a laser printer many years
ago that resulted in his leading us in this direction and you see that
collaboration between users and developers as at the core of the open
source movement. The original poster expressed a concern about a
certain behavior in i3, Michael essentially said &quot;I have more
important things to work on, from which you will benefit, so just
avoid provoking that behavior&quot;, and then Tony Crisci suggested a fix
that doesn't require Michael's involvement. This is the way it's
supposed to work. Read the OpenBSD mailing lists. While the tone is
too nasty for my taste, especially when Theo de Raadt gets involved,
he and they have a point: don't complain, send a patch!
