<PRE>This is getting meta, but (in a general sense) this:

&gt;<i> don't complain, send a patch
</I>
is a pretty unhelpful reaction in my eyes. So we can't open bugs if we
don't provide the fix as well? We can't ask for features without
implementing it? Most of us are busy and to be honest, I don't have the
time to dig into the source code of *every* application I'm using if I
feel that an improvement can be made. I wouldn't find time to eat, sleep
or earn my living anymore. Of course it's a good thing if someone does;
I just argue it shouldn't be a requirement.

That being said, I didn't think any of this was dramatic and I didn't
think Michael's or Jeff's responses were in any way &quot;unreasonable&quot;.
Someone asked a question, Michael made his stance, Tony provided a
reasonable solution.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it did read that way, pretty clearly. It's good that you realized
</I>&gt;<i> it yourself and sent the above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I think you are correct that it's unintended behavior -- a bug
</I>&gt;<i> -- but not important functionally, I think Michael's response is
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly reasonable, as the developer of good software for which we
</I>&gt;<i> must all remember he is giving us free of charge. I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> Michael, but I have seen indications that he's a busy guy. As someone
</I>&gt;<i> who had a 45-year career in software development, I can tell you that
</I>&gt;<i> just continuing development of i3 and providing the level of support
</I>&gt;<i> he does is a big job. And that's in addition to whatever he does to
</I>&gt;<i> earn his living and have a life. So, without trying to speak for him,
</I>&gt;<i> I'm guessing his response came from that perspective. It was also a
</I>&gt;<i> bit like the old joke about he fellow who says to the doctor &quot;Doctor,
</I>&gt;<i> when I do this, it hurts&quot;. To which the doctor responded &quot;Don't do
</I>&gt;<i> that&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would also add that we are living in an open source world. Part of
</I>&gt;<i> the point of open source is that we can all contribute to the
</I>&gt;<i> development of a piece of software. Read or listen to any of Richard
</I>&gt;<i> Stallman's descriptions of his issue with a laser printer many years
</I>&gt;<i> ago that resulted in his leading us in this direction and you see that
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration between users and developers as at the core of the open
</I>&gt;<i> source movement. The original poster expressed a concern about a
</I>&gt;<i> certain behavior in i3, Michael essentially said &quot;I have more
</I>&gt;<i> important things to work on, from which you will benefit, so just
</I>&gt;<i> avoid provoking that behavior&quot;, and then Tony Crisci suggested a fix
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't require Michael's involvement. This is the way it's
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to work. Read the OpenBSD mailing lists. While the tone is
</I>&gt;<i> too nasty for my taste, especially when Theo de Raadt gets involved,
</I>&gt;<i> he and they have a point: don't complain, send a patch!
