<PRE>Hi,

This is something have found useful in other window managers, and further to the comments in the i3status man page:

&gt;<i> It is hard to measure memory in a way which is accurate or meaningful
</I>
I find MemAvailable from /proc/meminfo most useful, assuming I understand it correctly.  MemTotal-MemAvailable would be even better.

&gt;<i> One reason for that is that I have not run out of memory in the last few years
</I>
Unfortunately I do reasonably often.  Either because other users are running programs on the machine, or particular processes are memory intensive (eg. virtual machines, CAE applications)

&gt;<i> Memory has become so cheap that even in my 4 year old notebook, I have 8 GiB of RAM.
</I>
I have 12GiB but it is not cost effective to replace this before replacing the machine.  Some programs/data sets have their memory requirements increased as hardware specs improve.

&gt;<i> Another reason is that your operating system will do the right thing anyway
</I>
It tends to thrash the swap space because all the running processes can't fit into physical RAM.  Sometimes the situation is so bad I have to reboot the machine.  'limit vmemoryuse' can help in some situations but not all.  A quick way of checking memory usage would help.

&gt;<i> you are probably better off with a script doing that, which pops up an alert when your RAM usage reaches a certain threshold
</I>
Maybe, but it would be nice if the option was built in anyway.  I don't suppose there is any way to add it as a user configuration?

thanks,
Rob
