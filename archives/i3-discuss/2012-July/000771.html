<PRE>Hi,

Since I failed to convince Michael to accept my newer patch, I decide to
drop those more &quot;advanced&quot; patch, and try to push this simple patch into i3.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This sometimes annoys me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; In this patch I change the above behavior to this: If a urgent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; workspace occurs, i3bar will unhide itself; and when you navigates
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; away from the last urgent workspace and there is no more urgent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; workspace, i3bar will hide itself again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds interesting, but have you discussed it with Michael first?
</I>&gt;<i> I'd recommend always pinging Michael first to see if what you intend
</I>&gt;<i> to do is in line with the project goals and things like that. Unless,
</I>&gt;<i> of course, you don't care about getting your patches merged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyways, some comments below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Oops... I messed it up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here is the patch fix build, and improve the behavior a little bit more:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When the urgent workspace is currently focused, i3bar will hide as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soon as the urgent mark has gone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please merge both patches in a single one to make it easier to review
</I>&gt;<i> (unless they do separate things, of course).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed you used &quot;if (&quot; and &quot;if(&quot;, please stick with &quot;if (&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> that's what the rest of xcb.c uses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You declare and read bar_hidden, but you never seem to write to it. Am
</I>&gt;<i> I missing something? Also, I'd rather have the code that calls
</I>&gt;<i> hide/unhide_bar simply not call those functions rather than do the
</I>&gt;<i> checking inside the functions, but that's subjective, I guess.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The indentation level on the call to hide_bars() in the last chunk of
</I>&gt;<i> the second patch is wrong. Are you sure you don't want that enclosed
</I>&gt;<i> by brackets, as part of the &quot;else&quot; branch?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Above problem are solved.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're doing all the logic in the drawing code. Perhaps it would be
</I>&gt;<i> better to detect that stuff directly in the ipc.c, when you receive
</I>&gt;<i> the workspace info from i3, after the call to parse_workspaces_json.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think it's fine. The original hide/unhide logical is done in draw_bar as
well, I just follow it. And I think the logical is simple enough to be
included in drawing code.
