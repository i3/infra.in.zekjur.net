<PRE>Hi,

Quoting ablepharus (2012-07-26 14:25:55)
&gt;<i> I would really like to write the desired Software and I would use django
</I>&gt;<i> for it. I would be ready for doing this alone, but of course I'd be
</I>&gt;<i> happy about some help. I have planned on writing such a service anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> without a target. I agree with the mentioned needs and restrictions.
</I>That&#8217;s nice to hear. I&#8217;d be happy to betatest anything you come up with.

By the way, I evaluated barkeep briefly. Here are my observations:

 &#8226; Deployment is horrible, as with most ruby projects :-/
 &#8226; Documentation is really sparse, and the existing documentation
   contained two errors (I opened an issue for one and fixed the other
   one right away).
 &#8226; The only distinction is between admin/normal users, that is, you
   cannot specify who&#8217;s able to comment or approve commits (not that
   approving has any effect, but&#8230;).
 &#8226; Authentification is possible only via OAuth with a horrible user
   experience. You are directly redirected to the configured OAuth
   provider (e.g. google) without any message. This is the biggest
   problem for my intended use. We really need to be able to create user
   accounts automatically to hand them out after somebody uploads a
   patch.
 &#8226; barkeep only supports a post-commit workflow. This means I&#8217;d have to
   build a site (and/or script) to upload patches and then have them be
   committed to a new branch automatically. No big deal, but see the
   points above &#8212; after all, it&#8217;s not really worth it I think.

I have to stress that barkeep really does it right in the user
interface. A list of commits, a nice diff and comments is really all I
want to have. I just think adjusting it is not that easy for now.

Best regards,
Michael
