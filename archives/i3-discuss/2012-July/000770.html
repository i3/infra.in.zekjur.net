&gt;<i> Hi Fernando,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quoting Fernando Lemos (2012-06-29 03:37:13)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When i3 is restarted, so is i3bar. Looks like when i3bar quits, its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window is destroyed and the embedded windows receive a BadWindow error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [1]. Seems to be a design issue in XEmbed itself:
</I>&gt;<i> They shouldn&#8217;t, though. Have a look at the code. When i3bar receives an
</I>&gt;<i> EOF (or does it not receive an EOF in that case? maybe we should make it
</I>&gt;<i> restart-aware) it first properly kills all embedded tray icons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What happens here, I guess, is that some clients may try to create the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tray icon again, while others may not. Or maybe they do, but i3bar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wasn't up by the time they retry (I'm guessing here, I really didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; read XEmbed).
</I>&gt;<i> In case they don&#8217;t retry, they are violating the spec. Also, the
</I>&gt;<i> embedder can be down for an arbitrary amount of time. The tray
</I>&gt;<i> application is supposed to deal with that. And at least nm-applet does
</I>&gt;<i> (so do all GTK-based ones probably). Note however that when the embedder
</I>&gt;<i> does not properly kill the tray clients, they may not retry at all. So
</I>&gt;<i> this is probably what&#8217;s happening here (as you described above).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; XEmbed also says that &quot;the protocol ends&quot; when the embedded window is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reparented to the root window [2]. So I don't know much about X, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe reparenting the embedded windows to the root window before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; terminating would be a solution? I'm not sure how the clients are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supposed to react, though.
</I>&gt;<i> As I said, we should be doing that :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What puzzles me is that you guys say it also happens when returning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from suspend... I have no idea why that is, I always thought suspend
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was (mostly) transparent to applications?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it definitely should be transparent to applications. My guess is
</I>&gt;<i> that for some reason, a monitor reconfiguration event is sent and i3
</I>&gt;<i> restarts i3bar because of that. However, that&#8217;s a different code path
</I>&gt;<i> than the i3 restart, so it&#8217;s quite a mystery to me currently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Michael
</I>&gt;<i>
