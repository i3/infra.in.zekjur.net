<PRE>Hi Bruno,

Quoting BRAGA, Bruno (2012-07-23 16:54:37)
&gt;<i> It is really a small thing, but decided to write about it anyway...&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> I know it is not a i3 bug, because the proc/acpi is returning this wrongfully.
</I>Rule of thumb: Please always describe what you are seeing. From your
screenshots, I think you are talking about your battery having a charge
status of more than 100%. While this might seem odd at first you have to
understand that the design capacity is only a value which the
manufacturer of the battery sets. It is perfectly normal that batteries
achieve more than that in their first few discharge cycles. Just as it&#8217;s
normal that the battery won&#8217;t achieve the full design capacity after
some discharge cycles :).

&gt;<i> 1) never allow battery value to surpass 100% (this happens specially while
</I>&gt;<i> using last full capacity) - this is not a bug, but it makes no sense to display
</I>&gt;<i> as such
</I>It does make sense to display it. The information that your battery is
fuller than normal is important, too.

&gt;<i> 2) the state shows charged but i3status displays BAT, as in discharging (I
</I>&gt;<i> believe this is a bug)
</I>Does this happen all the time? If so, can you check if your battery
uevent file contains the POWER_SUPPLY_STATUS key and which value it has
please?

&gt;<i> 3) when the charging is close to 100%, the battery goes red (I believe this
</I>&gt;<i> happens because of the remaining time to become full - and looks like a bug as
</I>&gt;<i> well)
</I>This is weird. The remaining time is only checked when the state is
'discharging'. But it displays CHR (charging) in your screenshot. Fixes
welcome.

Best regards,
Michael
