Hi all,

Vitalii Elenhaupt pointed me to this i3 IPC library for ruby:

https://github.com/veelenga/i3ipc-ruby

which is a fork of the i3-ipc library mentioned on the i3 website.

I would like to recommend that veelenga/i3ipc-ruby be added to the i3
website, and badboy/i3-ipc be removed or at least marked as
unmaintained. veelenga/i3ipc-ruby is more featureful than badboy's
one, including the ability to subscribe to events.

Hi Kareem,

Thank you for your recommendation. Really nice to hear that somebody likes
it.
I have already asked Michael to add it on i3 ipc web page. And actually, it
is already there:

http://build.i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html#_see_also_existing_libraries

But that is still the latest development doc. I am not aware when it will
be moved to the main stream.

Thanks,
Vitalii

Subject: [i3] Problems setting multi monitor
Message-ID: <3390004.382BWmSPyp@asaru>

Hello,

I try to launch an xrandr script to set the multi monitor configuration. The script works when called standalone after i3 startup, but not at startup

#!env python

import functools, subprocess, sys
call = functools.partial(subprocess.check_call, shell=True)

call("sleep 3")

if sys.argv[1] == "uni":
    call("xrandr --output DP2-2 --auto --primary")
    call("xrandr --output eDP1  --auto --left-of DP2-2")
    call("xrandr --output HDMI1 --auto --right-of DP2-2")
    

The sleep 3 I put just to test, shouldn't be needed.

It is launched as my first exec in my i3 config:

exec --no-startup-id /home/florian/software/bin/screen_config uni

but seems to have no effect at all, configuration is not changed.

What can be the problem there?

Thanks,
Florian

AFAIK, the shebang must be an absolute path. That is, you'll probably have more luck replacing #!env with #!/usr/bin/env.

How do you call it standalone? I'm assuming by invoking python manually.

It seemed to be a problem with PATH. Starting /usr/bin/python explicitly makes it work.

No, without python.


Some more questions:

*) The monitor in the middle is set primary and assigned workspace 2. Howeve the i3-nagbar always appears at workspace 1 (left of 2). How can I make the nagbar appears on the primary output?

*) For setting my backgrounds I use feh:

exec --no-startup-id feh --randomize --bg-max Bilder/Backgrounds 

This works fine if executed in a shell, after i3 startup. Each display is assigned a different background image, if the aspect ratio does not fit there are black bars. But if I put in my i3 config it behaves differently. It gives each screen the same background image. Instead of black bars there is another image under it when aspect ration does not fit. This question may not fit here, but maybe someone has an idea...

*) 
bar {
        status_command i3status
        # tray_output primary
}

puts the tray output on workspace 3, left of my primary. Activating the tray_output primary and restart (mod+shift+r) and it works like it should, tray on the primary. But a real restart (exit and log in again) screws it. There are no tray icons at all. The owncloud client (which is started using dex -ae i3) opens in a window, instead minmized. However, all programs that should appear in the tray are running (klipper, kmix)

Sorry for putting so much questions at you ;-)

Thanks!
Florian

Hi

It may not answer all your questions but I wanted to point out that
*py3status* [1] provides a *xrandr* *module* to handle your screen
layouts easily and automatically if you want (with click event support
to switch easily).

You can maybe take a look at the source code [2] to get inspiration for
your own or use it through py3status and contribute to it if you want ;)

DISCLAIMER : I created py3status, so ofc I'm biased but I sincerly think
that this module could help you one way or another

[1] py3status : https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status
[2] xrandr module :
https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/blob/master/py3status/modules/xrandr.py

Have a nice day

Subject: [i3] append layout works from commandline, but not from .i3/config
Message-ID: <20150811183723.6aeded21@haktar.galaxy.home>

Hello,

I have a layout stored in emacs.json (attached). When I run this command from
the commandline, everything works fine:

markus at haktar % i3-msg 'append_layout /home/markus/.i3/emacs.json'

But when I run this command from .i3/config, one placeholder is missing: the
one in the horizontal container next to emacs:

exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace $wsp3;
append_layout /home/markus/.i3/emacs.json'

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks for your help,

append_layout is a command, not a configuration directive. Just like
the workspace command you are using a line above, youâll need to use
i3-msg to send it.

Sorry, my fault: the statement above is in one line (the tickmarks might be a
hint that's easily overlooked...

Hope, that's in one line now:

exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace $wsp3; append_layout /home/markus/.i3/emacs.json'

See http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html for how to look at i3âs log.
It should give you some more details about whatâs going on.

Thanks for pointing me to py3status. Especially the xrandr plugin looks very interesting.

In fact I installed it today and actually started to play around with the battery_level plugin.

However it seems to be quite simplicistic like no notificiation on low battery and has some issues with multiple batteries. 

I also came along i3pystatus, which seems to be strive for the same like py3status, right? They have a more elaborate battery plugin, but no display configuration plugin at all. Are py3status and i3pystatus compatible anyhow?

Best Regards,
Florian

Some other modules (pomodoro) indeed provide notifications, it's just
that it has not been implemented/contributed in the battery_level one.

I'm always open to suggestions and contributions, feel free to come on
Freenode IRC #py3status channel if you want to talk about it more
"lively" or email me ;)

Even tho they use python as their primary language, these are two
separate projects with different approaches to enhance your i3bar. I
think the main one is still that py3status uses natively your
i3status.conf and enhance it [2] so you don't need any other config file
[1].

They both provide their own set of modules but those are not directly
compatible between them since their implementation is different. So I
guess it's just a matter of taste and contribution / discussion :)

Subject: [i3] Behavior of force_focus_wrapping
Message-ID: <3237431.maXOASm2kh@asaru>

Hello,

I have force_focus_wrapping yes set, which afaik is also the default.

Now having a container layout of a Browser and another container stacked. In this container is an Emacs and a Konsole, horizontally (in the sense that their border is a horizontal line).

(Stack Browser (H-Split Emacs Konsole) ;; Lisp like notation

Now I expect focus up to move focus from Konsole to Emacs and then to Browser. But is cycles only between Konsole and Emacs. I can focus parent and reach the Browser that way. When I move focus up from the Browser is moves to Konsole and then Emacs, I'm again in the cycle.

Or do I understand focus_wrapping wrong?

Thanks,
Florian

This sounds like you've set "force_focus_wrapping yes":

Subject: [i3] Make disabling output config option
Message-ID: <20150817074758.GF21654@kvmbude>

With 4.10.3 this fix was introduced:

https://github.com/i3/i3/commit/14e95e765eeb1fd103ee8821656b43bf69c5519d

This makes total sense, but in some cases it might be annoying.
I have a setup with 3 LCDs (all the same HP ZR24w) connected to an
nvidia gpu. 2 LCDs are connected via DVI and the 3rd one is connected
via DP.
I let my workstation run 24/7 so i just turn the screens on/off. While
the 2 LCDs on DVI are staying "connected" in the xrandr output when
turned off, the LCD on DP is "disconnected" (althought still physical
attached). So the workspaces from the 3rd LCD (DP) are moved to the
other ones, so i have to move them back to the 3rd LCD everytime i get
back home and turn the LCDs on again.

So it might be an idea to add an option to disable this feature.
Or does anyone have an idea how to let randr know that the device is
connected and just turned off?

Florian,

"force_focus_wrapping yes" is not the default. The default behaviour may 
be just what you're looking for (as Holger suggested)

 From what I can tell: force_focus_wrapping prevents focus from 
ascending up to the parent container.

Iâm not convinced i3 is the right layer to introduce options for this.

It sounds to me like your graphics driver incorrectly detects a
display as disconnected when you are using DisplayPort and the display
is turned off. Consider filing a bug against your graphics driver :).

Since there is a workaround i agree that it's nothing i3 should do. Was
just luck that it didn't occur earlier.

Subject: [i3] X session ends when last monitor turns off
Message-ID: <CACn7RsKzCng7jv=41sKE=cDoe9fY+j1C1nw=aJ0ZSEpN=C9fFg@mail.gmail.com>

I have a multi-monitor setup where I want to use *either* my laptop screen
*or* my external monitor. I've set up an "autoxrandr" script like this, to
enable an external monitor if it's connected, and to enable the laptop
panel otherwise:

#!/bin/bash
for output in $(xrandr | grep '\Wconnected' | awk '{ print $1 }'); do
    if [[ ! $output =~ ^LVDS.*$ ]]; then
       other=$output
    fi
done

if [ "$other" != "" ] ; then
  xrandr --output $other --auto --primary --output LVDS1 --off
else
  xrandr --output LVDS1 --auto --primary
fi

The trouble is that when the laptop is connected to an external screen, and
when I turn the monitor off, it seems that i3 exits. What I want instead is
that it either keeps running so that I can switch the laptop screen on, or
that I can configure it to automatically turn the laptop screen on.

I have no clue where to debug this. This is on Ubuntu 14.04 and using
lightdm. The lightdm logs say that the session (i3) exits and that's why
its stopping the session. I don't think I can get i3 logs using the
instructions at http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html because both i3 and the
X session are dead after this happens.

Any idea what I could try here?

Subject: [i3] GLFW_FLOATING window
Message-ID: <CADbJNDgSd1vqWub-xL0Ty8co8NMvUqS9Bu10hy0N0YsjU3Y=_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

GLFW has a window creation flag to make a window FLOATING, it uses
_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE
to do this in x11_window.c
<https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/b69b4a9f2a66159f670c5802d8105db211bfec3d/src/x11_window.c#L350-L357>
.

I have tried adding to the if statement in manage.c
<https://github.com/i3/i3/blob/next/src/manage.c#L374-L384> and the
corresponding xmacro to atoms.xmacro, but it still doesn't open as a
floating window.  After adding this, GLFW's check in x11_init.c
<https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/afe4aadade132f088a1d88145baed0b384c8d4e0/src/x11_init.c#L438-L439>
works,
it didn't before, so it seems to be registered within i3 correctly, but the
xcb_reply_contains_atom(state_reply, A__NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE) check still
fails.  Any idea why this could be happening?

Additionally, if I do get it working, would this be something worthy of
submitting? or should GLFW be changed to use something other than the
WM_STATE_ABOVE atom to make floating windows?  ...although none of the
tests used by i3 seem to be the right fit.

Thanks,
Kevin

Taking a step back, why does the window need to be floating at all? i3
deliberately only makes dialog windows floating, and if your window is
not a dialog window, it not being floating is working as intended.

Hi Kevin, 

On the bottom of manage.c you also need to increase the number of atoms that i3 lists as supported. Also make sure you added the new atom not at the very end of atoms.xmacro as not all of them are copied into the supported list and GLFW seems to actually check for support. 

If all of this is correct, it could only be that GLFW only sets the atom after the window is created. In this case you'd have to modify the handler. 

Regards 
Ingo

Hi Michael, 

I agree that there are better choices. On a side note, I noticed the other day that Google Hangout screen sharing opens a window to offer ending the screen share session with this very atom. That window definitely needs to float, though it's easy to argue that Chrome is at fault here and should use a more suitable atom.

Either way, i3 doesn't claim to support this atom and that alone should cause applications to not rely on it and instead use a more suitable atom.

Michael:
The reason I want the window to float is if I want a specific resolution
for the window (I'm working on an OpenGL project).  Especially if the
window is set to be not user-resizeable, i3 will still resize it to fit it
to a tile.  I had read that and thought that maybe that wouldn't be the
correct atom to use, but none of the ones i3 uses to determine whether to
make a window floating seem correct either (MODAL, DIALOG, UTILITY,
TOOLBAR, and SPLASH)

Ingo:
Thanks, I will look into that once I get back from work.  Also "instead use
a more suitable atom" do you know of any that would work? Otherwise should
this atom be added to i3's floating window detection?

Use for_window with floating enable:

Yes, and thatâs intentional. You can resize your tiles to show as much
of the window content as you need, and application authors should not
have a say on how you think arranging your workspace is best.

I donât think it should be added to the floating window detection. In
fact, I donât think the window you are describing should be floating,
unless users explicitly set it to floating.

Hi Kevin, 

Applications generally shouldn't dictate how the window manager has to manage windows. In fact the specs clearly state that the window manager is allowed to deny, allow or modify such requests and that the application needs to deal with that. Also note that if you provide proper information on the window (class or role etc.), any user can make sure that the window will float.

As for supporting the atom in i3, I'm all for i3 supporting more of the standards, but we need to find the appropriate way to handle these atoms and fully understand the consequences. It doesn't seem immediately clear to me that such windows must be floated. I think Michael seems to see it similarly. 

Regards 
Ingo

Hello Michael!

Ups, I'm sorry. It seems that using spamgourmet on the list might not be the
best idea... I hope, the thread isn't broken this time...?

Now I had the opportunity to follow those instructions. This is the log:
http://logs.i3wm.org/logs/5665370564198400.bz2

I had a look at it - but the data is a bit too much and I couldn't find any
hint. Maybe you could help me?

To remind you: the line mentioned above works fine when started from a
terminal (without exec... of course), but when called from the config file,
the placeholder for the window to the right of the emacs terminal is missing...

Thanks for your help!
(And if the threading is broken again, I'll re-subscribe without spamgourmet)

Itâs broken again at least in gmail, and you didnât have a To: address
set, which mailman didnât like.

Can you also provide the contents of /home/markus/.i3/emacs.json
please? Also, a screenshot of the working/non-working version would be
helpful.

While youâre at it, please file this as a bug at
https://github.com/i3/i3, so that we have all bugs in one place.
Thanks.

Subject: [i3] Killing of floating windows with mouse
Message-ID: <18009816.yTg8Ztdkxu@asaru>

Hello,

I have that line in my i3 config:

# The middle button over a titlebar kills the window
bindsym --release button2 kill

Which works perfectly on tiling windows, but not on floating windows. Instead I can grabe and move the window with the middle mouse button.

There is no other line containing "button2" in my config.

Thanks,
Florian

Are you aware of http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#shmlog? You donât
need to restart your X session.
