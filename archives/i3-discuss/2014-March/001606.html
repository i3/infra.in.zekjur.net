<PRE>Hello.

Since I always have the same layout ( basically, a horizontal layout 
with 1 vertical layout containing --at start-- 1 terminal on a side, and 
on the other one, 2 other terminals in a vertical layout: debugging and 
editing of unit testing for 2nd vertical layout, source code edition on 
first one ) on workspace 1, and start it every-time, I tried to do bind 
that script:

#!/bin/sh
x-terminal-emulator &amp;
x-terminal-emulator &amp;
i3-msg 'split v' &amp;
x-terminal-emulator &amp;

to a key, but it does not work. Started from a terminal, all windows 
appear, but only in a vertical layout, and the script writes 
&quot;[{&quot;success&quot;:true}]&quot;. Since it is a problem of speed, I can do a small 
workaround.

But, binded to a key, nothing appears.

So I tried another approach, which is to do that work only at i3's 
start-up. Here are the lines I added:

exect x-terminal-emulator
exect x-terminal-emulator
exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'split v'
exect x-terminal-emulator

Again, no terminal is spawned. Right after those lines, I had a section 
like this:

assign [class=&quot;XOsview&quot; ] 10
exec xosview

assign [class=&quot;Claws-mail&quot; ] 10
exec claws-mail

exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace 10'
exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace 1'

Which basically starts both xosview and claws on the 10th workspace, 
plus move each screen's starting workspace to 1 ( primary screen ) and 
10 ( second one ).
It worked fine, even with the added lines.
Now, I thought that the assignations are not useful if correct 
workspaces are selected before starting things. So I replaced those 
lines with:

exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace 10'
exec xosview
exec claws-mail
exec --no-startup-id i3-msg 'workspace 1'

which I thought would be ok, but the results are really strange:
xosview is started on workspace 1, claws on workspace 7 ( see note 
below ), and shown workspaces are correct with 1 and 10. If it would 
only be speed, I suppose that both applications would be on workspace 1, 
or one on workspace 10, or both on workspace 10 ( which is the desired 
behavior, finally ), but one is spawn on workspace 7.
I suppose that when i3 receives the command to switch to workspace 10 
which is on the secondary screen, it starts by switching to second 
screen, with the lowest possible workspace selected ( 7 in my case ), 
then switch to desired workspace.
Am I wrong? If I am, how could I work around that problem?

Thanks in advance for any advice, opinion, or pointer you could give me 
to fix and/or understand that problem.


NOTES:
Note 1:
Each screen have some affected workspaces 1-4 are for primary screen, 
5-6 are not affected, 7-10 are affected to secondary screen:

workspace 1 output $prim_screen
workspace 2 output $prim_screen
workspace 3 output $prim_screen
workspace 4 output $prim_screen

workspace 7 output $sec_screen
workspace 8 output $sec_screen
workspace 9 output $sec_screen
workspace 10 output $sec_screen

Note 2:
Using Debian (amd64) stable on some computers with some testing 
packages including i3. Unstable on another one.
x-terminal-emulator is used in my commands, and default terminal 
emulator on my computer is lxterminal.

PS:
I already noticed some bugs probably related to slowness of something. 
Often, at startup, I summon some terminals, switch to another workspace, 
try to summon things, and they are summoned on workspace 1, even if I 
started them when other workspace was shown.
Boring, but not critical, and I never had the will to fix it. Now, this 
layout problem is annoying enough for me to make me interesting in 
understanding why it does not work.
