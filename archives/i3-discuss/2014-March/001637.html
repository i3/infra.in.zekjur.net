<PRE>Hello Michael,

&gt;&gt;<i> But it's only a compromise if I understand the intention of the minute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aligning correctly.
</I>
&gt;<i> Why is it a compromise? What is the intention behind the minute
</I>&gt;<i> aligning?
</I>
I'm not sure as no one really explained it. From Gereon's comment 
regarding &quot;ugly numbers&quot; my guess is that the alignment should make sure 
that the refreshes happen in a deterministic way in order to display the 
time information in a consistent manner.

05s -&gt; 10s-&gt; 15s -&gt; 20s. You never see 01s 02s 03s 11s etc.

Therefore his preference to perform the alignment always, not only upon 
a new minute.


&gt;<i> I thought it&#8217;s to have an update at the beginning of every
</I>&gt;<i> minute, just as we align on full seconds.
</I>
My thinking initially, hence my patch. But now I'm not sure anymore.


&gt;<i> This will still be true with
</I>&gt;<i> the proposed change. And in case people who use minute alignment don&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> want to have updates during the minute, they should just not send
</I>&gt;<i> SIGUSR1 to i3status, right?
</I>
A bit prohibitive to my liking as the signal is very useful and I would 
rather find a solution that works for all use cases. But then I don't 
know how many users find the alignment essential. I don't include 
seconds with my clock. I could do without any alignment at all, 
therefore my idea to inspect the time information.

Personally, I'm fine with the patch. But in order to cater for all 
needs, I would find a new configuration option worth thinking about. 
This would enable all parties to choose the policy which makes most 
sense to them. The new default could be to align only once, but users 
would be able to disable alignment or enforce it always.

Cheers,
   Marco

</PRE>
