Hi Stephen,

Let me rephrase your asking: If you have the focus on emacs and open an
application you want it to not resize the emacs window.
If this is correct then this is not possible in i3 without a patch or
script, there is no such thing as a sticky/protected container which can
freeze its structure and delegate it to the next container (or create a new
one if required).

Michael what do you think about such a feature ? It captures the feeling of
one property of slave/master in some other WM but still let the user to do
it when and where it wants it which fits the philosophy of i3 in my
opinion. The tricky part is the visual clue about such containers/windows.

About the visual hint: how about doing this via a separate window
class/tag (like focused, unfocused, urgent etc.)?

I don?t see that as a good feature for i3. It does not strike me as
particularly useful, and it is solving an issue that only exists for
newcomers to i3.

Thanks Sylvain, yes, this is the sort of thing I was thinking of.  Never
mind if it is not available in i3, I am just experimenting!

I actually like this idea myself, and I've been using i3 exclusively for a 
few months now, and i3 was my first entry into tiling wms. I still
consider myself a novice though - I think I've basically learned just 
enough work fairly comfortably, but have no doubt acquired a few bad habits
and gaping holes in my understanding along the way. So excuse me if I 
misuse terms or show any obvious signs of luser. (:

To use Sylvain's summary: "a sticky/protected container which can freeze its 
structure and delegate it to the next container (or create a new one if required)."

... is something I would be able to immediately put to use in my usual
workfow.

In particular, the IntelliJ Idea editor is difficult to work with due to
the way it opens new editor windows. I want to have the main application
window remain ever-present to the left-half portion of my screen in
stacking mode, while each new editor window I open should appear to the 
right-half, also in stacking mode. So that each successive new editor
window opens to the right of the main application window, and is 
stacked below one another.

I believe that the feature in question would really make the above
scenario convenient and straight-forward, and doesn't require extra
keystrokes/commands or configuration to utilize other than the single 
'sticky/protected' command.


Kind regards!

Hi all,

FYI, the script with all themes is now available
on github:

https://github.com/okraits/j4-make-config

It has been renamed to j4-make-config to make clear that
it is not an official i3 project and to prepare it for
integration into http://www.j4tools.org/.

Greetings,

Oliver

Thanks for pointing me to j4tools. Finally dmenu opens fast. That?s

Message-ID: <20131008104201.GB7022@nyx>

When I?m on multiple monitors, the ?hit the same number key to jump to
the last workspace? is straightforward and simple.

Yet, when I?m on monitor #1 and want to quickly check something different
on #2, I normally intuitively hit the same key again and expect it to
jump back to the previous workspace on #2. But it instead focuses the
workspace from which I came, on monitor #1.

In case the workpace I jump to is already on monitor #2, hitting the key
again I expect it to jump back to #1 (which, of course, it does right
now).

Does anyone else have the same problem? Could this be implemented to be
available via rc?

I'm also interested in this. I end up with nested containers that I 
don't need, but getting them to go away generally involves messing up 
and then restoring my layout.

Please post a logfile of this happening. Remember to keep the session
