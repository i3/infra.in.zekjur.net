<PRE>Hi all,

first off: Thanks for this wonderful window manager! I've tried many
others before and this is the only one that doesn't make me look for
other alternatives :)

On topic:

The only thing I think could be improved in i3 is the config. i3 uses
its own configuration file format which is quite restricted. Therefor, I
suggest moving to a well-established scripting language that can be
embedded into i3's C code - lua comes to mind.

The advantages I see:

- Profit from lua's development history to have a safe, stable and yet
  feature-rich embedded scripting language
- Avoid maintenance of own configuration file format (features + bug
  fixes)
- Open lua for scripting: Allow lua callback functions to modify lua's
  behaviour in situations like &quot;New window created&quot; or &quot;Key combination
  pressed&quot;
- Allow users to script configuration, e.g. use for-loop from 0-9 to
  bind keys for switching to workspaces or moving windows to workspaces

What I did so far:

I created a purely C- and lua-based test application which allows:
- Call lua functions from C
- Call C functions from lua
- Pass C structs to lua script
- Modify C structs in lua script

What I could do next:

- Integrate the functionality into i3's codebase
- Create a public git branch (based on i3 'next') to demonstrate and
  discuss

What I can't do:

- Give any guarantees on development time

What I need to know:

- Is this something the i3 developers would want?

Thanks in advance for your time.

Kind regards,

Timo
