<PRE>Well,
1]
I do not pretend to understand this, but I “fixed” the link issue. Though my fix leaves me a tiny bit squeamish. I was able to get past the linker error with this modification to common.mk:

LDFLAGS ?= $(as_needed_LDFLAG) -u xcb_str_sizeof

Can someone please help me to understand what –u actually did? Is it a safe modification?

I’ll note that inside /usr/lib64 is an older version of libxcb (1.8). It is there only because I needed to do the following (libX11-devel depends on libxcb):
yum install libX11-devel

My concern is to ensure that the newer versions of the libxcb stuff (that I compiled) overrides the old stuff found in /usr/lib64.

2]
Other changes that I made to common.mk include:
I3_CFLAGS  = -std=c99 -I/usr/local/cwp/include
LIBS = -L$(TOPDIR) -li3 -lm -L/usr/local/cwp/lib

Is there an environment variable that I could have defined which would have prevented the need for these last two lines?

3]
Last question relates to some of the libxcb elements that I did not seem to have to build. These include:
xcb-proto, xcb-util-image, xcb-util-renderutil

The fact that I did not have to build these seems odd. Should I have built them for completeness? I’ll also note two libraries that I had to build, which were not listed in DEPENDS: xcb-util-wm and xcb-util-keysyms.

4]
As mentioned I will fully publish my procedures, once I scrub them. I will stand up a new box and go step by step through my procedures, at that point I will put them online.

I’m about to try to give i3 a run now that it is built… fingers crossed.

Johannes,

Thanks again for helping me past that compile issue.



I am now attempting to link. I got past a problem with a spurious -l by changing how I disabled pango.



Apparently the proper way to disable pango is as follows (common.mk snippet):



#PANGO_CFLAGS := $(call cflags_for_lib, cairo)

#PANGO_CFLAGS += $(call cflags_for_lib, pangocairo)

I3_CPPFLAGS  += -DPANGO_SUPPORT=0

#PANGO_LIBS   := $(call ldflags_for_lib, cairo)

#PANGO_LIBS   += $(call ldflags_for_lib, pangocairo)



The link issue I am seeing is an undefined xcb symbol:


[i3] Link i3
/usr/lib64/libxcb-render.so.0: undefined reference to `xcb_str_sizeof'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [i3] Error 1



I found the following online:

<A HREF="http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=95934&amp;sid=ca175185bed9514c33942f4795f29892">http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=95934&amp;sid=ca175185bed9514c33942f4795f29892</A>



Here it was suggested that –rdynamic be added to the link options. This did not work for me.



Which library should contain this symbol?
