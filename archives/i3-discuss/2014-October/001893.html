<PRE>Hi,

As for a configuration file format, there are a lot of complications 
with using a script, such as requiring people to learn a programming 
language to configure the window manager as well as the technical 
complexity and the matter of backwards compatability. For those reasons, 
I think we are better off where we are for now.

However, i3 is already fully scriptable in Lua with the i3ipc-glib 
project (<A HREF="https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-glib">https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-glib</A>).

I even created a wrapper library especially for lua which you can find 
here: <A HREF="https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-lua">https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-lua</A>

You are welcome to contribute to either of these projects if you don't 
find the features you want by contributing code or making feature 
requests on those projects.

You can do all the things you mentioned with the ipc events.

Check out all the different window events you can subscribe to: 
<A HREF="http://build.i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html#_window_event">http://build.i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html#_window_event</A>

We even just added a &quot;binding&quot; event in the development version you can 
use to listen for keypresses that are bound to a command: 
<A HREF="http://build.i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html#_binding_event">http://build.i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html#_binding_event</A>

I support this library on the mailing list, the official i3 faq, and in 
the irc channel (nick: TonyC).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On topic:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing I think could be improved in i3 is the config. i3 uses

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The advantages I see:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Profit from lua's development history to have a safe, stable and yet
</I>&gt;<i>    feature-rich embedded scripting language
</I>&gt;<i> - Avoid maintenance of own configuration file format (features + bug
</I>&gt;<i>    fixes)
</I>&gt;<i> - Open lua for scripting: Allow lua callback functions to modify lua's
</I>&gt;<i>    behaviour in situations like &quot;New window created&quot; or &quot;Key combination
</I>&gt;<i>    pressed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - Allow users to script configuration, e.g. use for-loop from 0-9 to
</I>&gt;<i>    bind keys for switching to workspaces or moving windows to workspaces
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I did so far:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I created a purely C- and lua-based test application which allows:
</I>&gt;<i> - Call lua functions from C
</I>&gt;<i> - Call C functions from lua
</I>&gt;<i> - Pass C structs to lua script
</I>&gt;<i> - Modify C structs in lua script
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I could do next:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Integrate the functionality into i3's codebase
</I>&gt;<i> - Create a public git branch (based on i3 'next') to demonstrate and
</I>&gt;<i>    discuss
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I can't do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Give any guarantees on development time
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I need to know:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Is this something the i3 developers would want?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for your time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Timo
