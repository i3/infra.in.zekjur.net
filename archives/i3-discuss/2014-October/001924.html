<PRE>I will certainly try that as well Sean. Thanks for pointing me to that. 

Now that I'm through the steps, and have documented them carefully, in some ways the source rpm will be a step back. However peeking into it may give me some clues relative to some of the questions I had.

Thanks very much.

Have you tried getting the Rawhide SRPM and building it?

<A HREF="http://mirrors.tummy.com/pub/fedora.redhat.com/fedora/linux/development/rawhide/source/SRPMS/i/i3-4.8-5.fc22.src.rpm">http://mirrors.tummy.com/pub/fedora.redhat.com/fedora/linux/development/rawhide/source/SRPMS/i/i3-4.8-5.fc22.src.rpm</A>

Then use &quot;rpmbuild --rebuild i3-4.8-5.fc22.src.rpm&quot;.

That's what I did to get 4.8 built on my Ubuntu system, but back-porting the dpkg instead of the SRPM.

Leverage the work other's have already done.

Johannes,

Thanks again for helping me past that compile issue.



I am now attempting to link. I got past a problem with a spurious -l by changing how I disabled pango.



Apparently the proper way to disable pango is as follows (common.mk snippet):



#PANGO_CFLAGS := $(call cflags_for_lib, cairo)

#PANGO_CFLAGS += $(call cflags_for_lib, pangocairo)

I3_CPPFLAGS  += -DPANGO_SUPPORT=0

#PANGO_LIBS   := $(call ldflags_for_lib, cairo)

#PANGO_LIBS   += $(call ldflags_for_lib, pangocairo)



The link issue I am seeing is an undefined xcb symbol:


[i3] Link i3
/usr/lib64/libxcb-render.so.0: undefined reference to `xcb_str_sizeof'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [i3] Error 1



I found the following online:

<A HREF="http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=95934&amp;sid=ca175185bed9514c33942f4795f29892">http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=95934&amp;sid=ca175185bed9514c33942f4795f29892</A>



Here it was suggested that –rdynamic be added to the link options. This did not work for me.



Which library should contain this symbol?

The message says, that libxcb-render misses a link already, right? So it's not the problem in the i3-compile step, if I understand that correctly.

Did you check the following?
$ ldd /usr/lib64/libxcb-render.so
        linux-vdso.so.1 =&gt;  (0x00007ffff61ff000)
        libxcb.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib64/libxcb.so.1 (0x00007fa7c9398000)
        libXau.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib64/libXau.so.6 (0x00007fa7c9194000)
        libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fa7c8e00000)

Well,
1]
I do not pretend to understand this, but I “fixed” the link issue. Though my fix leaves me a tiny bit squeamish. I was able to get past the linker error with this modification to common.mk:

LDFLAGS ?= $(as_needed_LDFLAG) -u xcb_str_sizeof

Can someone please help me to understand what –u actually did? Is it a safe modification?

I’ll note that inside /usr/lib64 is an older version of libxcb (1.8). It is there only because I needed to do the following (libX11-devel depends on libxcb):
yum install libX11-devel

My concern is to ensure that the newer versions of the libxcb stuff (that I compiled) overrides the old stuff found in /usr/lib64.

2]
Other changes that I made to common.mk include:
I3_CFLAGS  = -std=c99 -I/usr/local/cwp/include LIBS = -L$(TOPDIR) -li3 -lm -L/usr/local/cwp/lib

Is there an environment variable that I could have defined which would have prevented the need for these last two lines?

3]
Last question relates to some of the libxcb elements that I did not seem to have to build. These include:
xcb-proto, xcb-util-image, xcb-util-renderutil

The fact that I did not have to build these seems odd. Should I have built them for completeness? I’ll also note two libraries that I had to build, which were not listed in DEPENDS: xcb-util-wm and xcb-util-keysyms.

4]
As mentioned I will fully publish my procedures, once I scrub them. I will stand up a new box and go step by step through my procedures, at that point I will put them online.

I’m about to try to give i3 a run now that it is built… fingers crossed.
