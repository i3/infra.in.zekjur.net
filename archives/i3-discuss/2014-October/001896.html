<PRE>Hi Tony,

thanks for your reply!

&gt;<i> As for a configuration file format, there are a lot of complications with
</I>&gt;<i> using a script, such as requiring people to learn a programming language to
</I>&gt;<i> configure the window manager as well as the technical complexity and the
</I>&gt;<i> matter of backwards compatability.
</I>
I admit that integrating lua into i3 is potentially a bit more complex
than keeping an already existing parser. I thought it would've been
worth a try.

I don't agree with your argument about people having to learn a
programming language, though. First, i3's configuration language is a
language that needs to be learned, too. And secondly: If you want to
script i3 as it is now, you not only have to learn a programming
language, you also need to write, run and maintain your own process
communicating with i3.

However, I will definitely experiment with i3's IPC interface. The good
thing is that there is a python API. Like this, I even get to use my
favourite programming language :)

Kind regards,

Timo

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I even created a wrapper library especially for lua which you can find here:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;first off: Thanks for this wonderful window manager! I've tried many

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;On topic:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The only thing I think could be improved in i3 is the config. i3 uses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;its own configuration file format which is quite restricted. Therefor, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;suggest moving to a well-established scripting language that can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;embedded into i3's C code - lua comes to mind.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The advantages I see:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Profit from lua's development history to have a safe, stable and yet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   feature-rich embedded scripting language
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Avoid maintenance of own configuration file format (features + bug
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   fixes)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Open lua for scripting: Allow lua callback functions to modify lua's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   behaviour in situations like &quot;New window created&quot; or &quot;Key combination
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   pressed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Allow users to script configuration, e.g. use for-loop from 0-9 to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   bind keys for switching to workspaces or moving windows to workspaces
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;What I did so far:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I created a purely C- and lua-based test application which allows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Call lua functions from C
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Call C functions from lua
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Pass C structs to lua script
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Modify C structs in lua script
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;What I could do next:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Integrate the functionality into i3's codebase
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Create a public git branch (based on i3 'next') to demonstrate and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   discuss
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;What I can't do:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Give any guarantees on development time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;What I need to know:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- Is this something the i3 developers would want?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Thanks in advance for your time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
