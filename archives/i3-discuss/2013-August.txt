Subject: [i3] Experimental modal UX for i3
Message-ID: <CAGb_FfbdH--mBrZ+3Xz7VeS7gusyTZkB-cnu1kCdXorpVgFEag@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Big user of i3 here from Canada, Quebec.
First a big thanks to the whole community for such a damn good WM.

Recently I tried to encapsulate all the key bindings of i3 in a main mode
called.... i3 which can be enabled and disabled by pressing $mod key.
The result can be seen here:
https://raw.github.com/syl20bnr/config/master/.i3/config

It has now sub modes and their names are displayed with a breadcrumb style.
It is possible to go up in the hierarchy by pressing backspace or discard
any current mode with Escape or $mod.
I read somewhere that Michael uses an ergo keyboard with some levels, I
guess this config reproduces the feeling.

The missing part is the toggle feature for the i3bar (I want to stick i3bar
when an i3 mode is enabled and hide it when leaving a mode).

Anyway being able to do it so easily in i3 is like a dream comes true. so
here is why I'm happy to share !

As far as I know, i3bar (in hide mode) will show automatically when a
mode is activated. Furthermore, in the next branch in git i3 has a
command for showing/hiding i3bar and switching between dock and hide
mode:

I am not sure what you are trying to say, so let me be clear and say
that this feature exists in the git ?next? branch:

http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/commit/?h=next&id=e3913093b6b233ec30ce7fc8504d095f55c5e1db

It will be included in the next release.

Hi

i3-dmenu-desktop was always a bit slow for me so one day I rewrote it
in C/++. In the last few weeks I worked on it again for a few hours or
two and now I think it can actually be used by people...

For compiling from source it doesn't require anything except cmake and
a compiler with some support for C++11, not much though, so GCC 4.6
probably works, too.

It doesn't support the --entry-type option i3-dmenu-desktop has, but
allows overriding the terminal emulator directly (--term)

Here you go: https://github.com/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop

Just tried next branch and it works like justus wrote without changing
anything in my config.
I tested in the current release 4.5.1 and the i3 bar automatically hide
itself even with an active mode.
I stick with the next branch for now, thank you.

Hi,

the following doesn't work (it doesn't raise a config error, either):

set $mod Mod4
set $audiomod $mod+Ctrl
bindsym $audiomod+j exec mpc ...

But the following does:

bindsym $mod+Ctrl+j exec mpc...

Is the former method just not supported (then it should raise a config
error instead of failing silently) or is there a wrong anywhere else?

>From the documentation:

"Variables are directly replaced in the file when parsing. There is no
fancy handling and there are absolutely no plans to change this."

So variables behavior in i3 are more like macros, there is no type behind
and it is good like this.
If you set $var "value" then any subsequent $var will be replace by "value"
with the double quotes.
This is a good choice to keep it simple but I think that the lack of
recursive evaluation is counter intuitive and fail somehow to provide all
the potential of the KISS approach.

Anyway I guess I could try to make a patch for this, it should be trivial.

I doubt it?s trivial :). Currently I can?t think of a reason why we
could not merge such a patch, but let?s discuss this more in depth once
we actually have a patch.

I.e.: go ahead and submit your patch to http://cr.i3wm.org/

After a quick glance on src/config_parser.c I would suggest not to
implement this* but rather change the docs to state more clearly that
one simply doesn't walk int... doesn't define variables using other
variables

[mabe]

* I think it's complex enough, for now

Hi

sometimes the status line can get rather long (for example if one
displays the subject of the newest mail or the song currently played)
and it seems as i3bar doesn't handle this situation correctly.

I'm not a hundred percent sure here, but it seems like the N rightmost
pixels become corrupted, with N beingt the same amount that the text
is too long.

As I don't think this is expected behaviour I'm trying to locate the
issue and prepare a patch.

Subject: [i3] Case-sensitive workspace names
Message-ID: <CAGb_FfbbD429KwzQfRE28hDVPdQJWmK=ZbC+5FR0T4JKNhMgwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

First, some context to understand why it would be useful in my use case.
I'm still experimenting in i3 config and try to work without any
pre-defined set of workspaces, basically I try to use *anonymous*
workspaces without any key bindings or information about workspaces stored
in config. One benefit of this approach is to have a lot of single window
workspaces (I start to use chromium apps feature) where the name or the
position of the workspace don't matter, only the type of application and
window attribute are used to navigate (coupled with back and forth).
For this approach I wrote some scripts using dmenu to manage workspaces
(jump, send to output) and windows (jump, send to workspace, jump for
terminals etc).
To select a workspace dmenu proposes all possible workspace names composed
of only one character. I have a patched dmenu which can return
automatically when only one candidate matches the filter so selecting a
workspace is pretty quick since I have to press only one character.

So given this context, I could have 26 more possible workspaces in i3 (and
a whole new world of freedom and possibilities given my current mood) if
there was support for case-sensitive workspace names.

Well, I know this is borderline stuff, just asking :-))

You could probably have used i3-input -l 1 to return immediately after
one character has been pushed - I do that in my config to mark windows
with any letter & goto them easily.

Just update another one, I will only process the newest one.

Also, please make the title shorter and put the reference into the description.

Maybe http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/62252 helps?

Subject: [i3] About "bindelse" and "time out" feature requests for binding
	modes
Message-ID: <CAGb_FfY=nuT8CPSbe_S5b5FpTq6dsg521Me5-H2t2fz6MQW_ag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I read the following ticket listed as major priority:
http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/662

First it is quite old, but that's not the point.

Second I doubt that any of these features would be really useful.
The "time out" is clearly a bad idea. Letting the computer deciding itself
to reset a mode which has been enabled by the user can introduce some sort
of desynchronization between the user and the computer state. Depending on
his mood one can perceive the time differently so a fixed time out value
can be sometime confusing. It ends up that there is no good fixed value for
such a time out.
The "bindelse" is less "evil" but it does not address the issue, for
instance, if I press the wrong key, my reflex is to immediately correct
this move and press the good key. In the case of "bindelse" the first wrong
key would reset the mode and the effect of the next good input is undefined.

So I think that this post has one solution:
http://infra.in.zekjur.net/archives/i3-discuss/2011-January/000180.html

The reply is clear: "This appears to be the silver bullet!"
This already working solution allows a fine-grained control of which inputs
reset the mode.

The next reply about sticky idea is very clever and reflect what I
experienced when playing with binding modes. It happens that if one key
should reset the mode then there is a high chance that the whole key
binding group should do it too.

For now I have a bunch of "mode default" and it's fine.

Thank you Ian, I binded "i3-input -P i3-msg " to a key, very useful for
rarely used commands.
For the rest I prefer dmenu, I'm currently building up a whole i3
environment driven by dmenu. I will share it when it is ready.

Soooooooooo it does not answer my question :-)
Is it possible to have case-sensitive workspace names ?

If you don't know it yet you may find quickswitch-i3 [1] useful. It
creates dmenu menus for workspaces, clients etc.

Regarding your original question: No I don't think this is possible at
the moment. But you could monkey patch it into your dmenu script. For
example, convert all workspace names matching "_[A-Z]" to A-Z. On
return from dmenu you convert A-Z back to the original string by just
prepending an underscore or some similar delimiter. Con: the workspace
name and what you type to get to it are different.

quickswitch-i3 is nice.
The monkey patch should do it perfectly, it's not a big issue that the
actual workspace name is different. Thank you very much.

Up until this version I could right-click the i3bar to switch back to
the last workspace with my config (the switch-back feature for the
currently active number turned on).

I read something about how i3bar is now able to process click events but
couldn?t find anything in the manpages for i3bar and i3.

What changed? Can this be enabled again, or are there even cooler
things possible now?

See http://i3-wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html#_click_events for info
about click events.

Click events basically allow i3status-like programs (i3pystatus uses
this) to react to user input. For example in i3pystatus you can click
on the MPD block to play/pause.

When making the patch back then I was not aware of that feature and
nobody did notice it. Seems like there wasn't a test for it.

Unfortunately, there no tests for keyboard or mouse input at all.

In case anyone wants to add them, that?d be a welcome addition to the
test suite.

Hmm, I just took a look at the relevant part of the source (that
should be in i3bar/src/xcb.c in handle_button) and don't see anything
handling a right click, besides click events.

git diff 13f4a9f..5adb09 -- xcb.c (the first rev is 4.5.1, the second
the rev immediately before click events were added) gives no changes
at all. In 13f4a9f I don't see anything handling a right click either,
btw.

What version of i3/i3bar where you using prior to 4.6?

Has this been a feature or a side effect of something else? It was very
convenient when you only had one hand on the mouse (EATING!).

Always the newest (you are kind of forced to on Arch).

A pet peeve of mine is telling people that ?the newest? is a really bad
way of specifying a version. What does it mean? The newest version that
you cared to install? The newest that your distribution made available?
The newest from a git repository? Which one? Which branch? Which time
did you check out?

The most reasonable way is using i3 --version and i3bar --version.

I realize that you don?t have the binary around anymore, I just didn?t
want to let your statement stand on its own here :).

Message-ID: <CAA+gWiyjUHtCk6fmgmC-8RwPouzukm9r=GbMnkC5-JbhFGzf0w@mail.gmail.com>

When you enter full screen in smplayer while watch a video (with
hotkey f), you can move the mouse at the bottom of the screen for the
seek bar to appear.
If i enter fullscreen from within smplayer and then press mod+f from
i3, i can see the seek bar but i also have window borders + i3bar
showing.

After the upgrade to 4.6 in archlinux, it doesn't work anymore. I
doubled checked with a downgrade that it works properly on the
previous version 4.5.1.
Toggling the "bypass window manager" from smplayer floating control
settings, does change anything as well.

I also just installed vlc to test and it seems it has the same
problem. Gnome mplayer seems fine.

I would appreciate if you can git bisect 4.5.1 and 4.6 to see which
change precisely causes the issue.

You can find plenty of guides for bisecting on the internet and ask
specific questions in the #i3 IRC channel.

Thanks.

Hello. I just did a bisect from 4.5.1 to 4.6.
The offending commit is this one: raise fullscreen windows on top of
all other X11 windows
http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/commit/?id=0659a0d98ca98fcd134c277c6a61ca3c9a04544e

Reverting it resolves the problem. Thanks!

Message-ID: <520A4AB5.9020205@necoro.eu>

Hi all,

to help people googling it etc, here is the patch allowing to use icons
in i3bar ported to version 4.6. (Note: This is no in-depth porting, but
just tailored to 'applies, compiles and works' (TM)).

NB: Patch is based upon the version of Nick Lanham [1].

Remark: I'd still like to see some central i3 patch repository :).

- Ren?

Hi,

I am running i3wm 4.6.

with the following relevant settings.

new_float normal
new_window none

hide_edge_borders both
for_window [class="Xpdf"] floating enable

When xpdf is launch, it is borderless.
Not sure if this one is a bug or some configuration problem.

Any other apps that I define this way as flowing window does not have
border.

Check the log to be sure why this is happening, see
http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html

In case you think what is happening here is incorrect, feel free to file
a bugreport (with a logfile of course!) and we can investigate.

Hi all,

I just joined your community as I'm few months working productively with
i3wm, I want to give back what I get from this project.
I've being improving i3 configuration since the day 1 to match with my
laptop needs, I must say, it gets the 80% of everything. But I always
missed the fact that the volume keys are not working out of the box, and
turns out it is quite simple to achieve that, so I wonder if it can be
added to the initial config script, as it can help users to don't bother
about that small useful feature.

I added in my config the option to raise and low the volume with amixer,
I'm sure there must be a better way to do that, so if anyone knows better
... share it!

# Section to control the Master output
bindSym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec amixer set Master 1%+
bindSym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec amixer set Master 1%-
bindSym XF86AudioMute exec amixer -D pulse set Master 1+ toggle

#Section to control the Capture (mic)
bindSym Shift+XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec amixer set Capture 1%+
bindSym Shift+XF86AudioLowerVolume exec amixer set Capture 1%-
bindSym Shift+XF86AudioMute exec amixer set Capture 1+ toggle

Hope easy the search from other people. I was planning to add a blog
entrance, but I think is better that gets linked to the community.

I think is good, too. Most of the bindings are selfexplanatory and it is 
easier to erase bindings than to read through the user guide, which is 
great but really long. Hence a bloated config would be fine. Adding all 
possible options, but commented out, would be convenient too.

  have something to add to Julios idea: Use the -M option of amixer. 
"amixer set Master 1%+" increases the volume linearly. But the 
characteristic line of the human ear is a logarithmic funtion. "-M" 
Tries to compensate this to achieve a felt linear increasment of volume.

The problem I see with this: Some (lots of) people use Pulse, others
Jack (and that only part of the time).

If that is included, these bindings should depend on which audioserver
is used (if that?s even detectable).

I think the purpose of that bindings wouldn't be to show how to change
volume but rather what names the media keys have.

I'm always reluctant about looking those up with e.g. xev

I dont know if this can be taken for general, but in my case giving no 
device takes the default device, which should be fine for everyone.

bindSym XF86AudioRaiseVolume  exec --no-startup-id "amixer -qM set 
Master 9%+"
bindSym XF86AudioLowerVolume  exec --no-startup-id "amixer -qM set 
Master 9%-"
bindSym XF86AudioMute         exec --no-startup-id "amixer -q  set 
Master toggle"

@David, in this case the OS is irrelevant, you have to look more if you use
X or Wayland or anything else.

@Manuel, that's what I also think, at least they should appear in the
config, it will save time googling or just the feeling not working in i3
(when actually it works smooth!)

As others have pointed out, it?s not that simple. The following points
are the reason why this will not be added to the default config:

 ? different people have different tastes in how the volume should be
   changed
 ? different distributions require different ways of changing the volume
 ? the keybinding is not generally useful; many machines don?t have it,
   many people won?t ever use it

Thanks for your proposal, though.

Hi,

i3lock doesn't seem to get numbers when typed on the keypad and refuses
to unlock the screen even when the password was typed correctly.

i3lock inverts the numlock for whatever reason.
So if you can type with your numpad when the screen is unlocked, you
have to press the numlock key in order to type numbers when the screen
is locked.

Odd. I never use the numpad, so I didn?t notice this when testing. Since
i3lock 2.5, we actually use libxkbcommon for the entire input
handling. Please check that you have the latest version of that and
report a bug with the authors at
https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon

Thanks!

Message-ID: <x6k3j2yvtn.fsf@midna.lan>

Hi SardemFF7, fernandotcl,

you guys are knowledgable in all things pango :). Recently,
http://bugs.i3wm.org/query/ticket/1073 was reported and I don?t really
know what the issue is here.

With some text, e.g. ??: 100%? (try a couple others if that doesn?t
trigger it on your machine), the font height is 15 pixels instead of the
12 pixels that were determined in load_pango_font(), leading to 3
missing pixels.

I figured this out by adding the following code:

--- i/libi3/font.c
+++ w/libi3/font.c
@@ -98,6 +98,10 @@ static void draw_text_pango(const char *text, size_t text_len,
     pango_cairo_update_layout(cr, layout);
     pango_cairo_show_layout(cr, layout);
 
+    gint height;
+    pango_layout_get_pixel_size(layout, NULL, &height);
+    LOG("saved height = %d, height = %d\n", savedFont->height, height);
+
     /* Free resources */
     g_object_unref(layout);
     cairo_destroy(cr);

However, I am not sure why this happens. Is there some kind of font
fallback involved for the ?unusual? unicode glyphs?

Is there something we can do to fix this?

Thanks.

One of the devs has answered and says it needs to be fixed in i3lock.
