<PRE>Thanks very much for your detailed answer! I will study it carefully and
make some experiments and maybe come up with a tree-model I can understand
better--something I love doing. I like i3 very much because:
(1) trees are IMO a better starting point than the column models others use;
(2) I hate having to go through the pre-designed layouts given to you by
some others (e.g. awesome and xmonad) (in the Microsoft spirit of &quot;We know
what's best for you&quot;).
So I'm glad i3 has surprises! (I think the tragedy of doing mathematics is
that you start with something totally magical, and you put in a lot of
thought and work to understand it; and if you succeed you destroy its magic
(but not totally!).)

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Excerpts from Harry Allenby's message of 2013-07-15 07:50:39 +0200:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm a very literal-minded mathematician
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then let me, as a fellow mathematician try to explain at least part of
</I>&gt;<i> your questions ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (3) I just don't grasp the concept of a container in i3. It seems to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me that the basic objects are windows, and that &quot;container&quot; is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; derived, relational notion, namely: two windows may (or may not) be in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same container. [So, mathematically, I think of a container as an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; equivalence class of windows; but I don't know what the equivalence
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relation is.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mathematically it is pretty simple. Containers are nodes in a tree,
</I>&gt;<i> whose root the X-root-window is. Children of this root level there are
</I>&gt;<i> individual outputs, children of the outputs are the workspaces, whose
</I>&gt;<i> children in turn are the container-trees containing the windows you see.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A container can either be an inner node containing more containers (I
</I>&gt;<i> think this is called a &#8222;split-container&#8220; in the documentation), or it
</I>&gt;<i> can be a leaf, containing a window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The nodes are not all equal, leafs contain windows and near the top of
</I>&gt;<i> the hierarchy there has to be special treatment (to use the more
</I>&gt;<i> user-friendly abstractions of outputs and workspaces), but mostly this
</I>&gt;<i> should be the way to think of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (2) If I press mod+v and make some windows, are they all in the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; container? If I now press mod+h and make some more windows, are they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a different container?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes and no. If by &#8222;window&#8220; you think of &#8222;a leaf node in the container
</I>&gt;<i> tree&#8220;, then yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you create some windows (for example pressing Mod+Enter to
</I>&gt;<i> open some terminals), then each one is put in an individual container.
</I>&gt;<i> These containers are then put in a big container. If you then press
</I>&gt;<i> mod+h, the currently focused node in the tree (which would be a leaf in
</I>&gt;<i> most cases, so a container having a window inside it) is replaced by a
</I>&gt;<i> new container, with the old content as a subtree. If you then open some
</I>&gt;<i> windows, they are new leafs which are put in that new container.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I think the solution here is to stop thinking about windows as
</I>&gt;<i> entities in the container-tree, because they're really not. The
</I>&gt;<i> container-tree is an abstraction used by i3 and leaf-nodes in this tree
</I>&gt;<i> have a window-property attached to them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (1) I'm sitting in front of an i3-screen with a focused window. I want
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to know (preferably in a semi-algorithmic statement), if I press Mod +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; s, exactly which windows will be stacked. In particular, does the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answer depend on the history of the focused window?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm actually not very clear of this myself. It just magically does
</I>&gt;<i> exactly what I want. I _think_ the container being stacked is always the
</I>&gt;<i> parent of the currently focused container.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, if you just open a bunch of terminals on an empty workspace, focus
</I>&gt;<i> one of them, your layout would be something like (I apologize for my
</I>&gt;<i> crude ASCII-art):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Workspace
</I>&gt;<i>     /  |  |  | \
</I>&gt;<i>    C1 C2 C3 C4 C5
</I>&gt;<i>    |  |  |  |  |
</I>&gt;<i>    T1 T2 T3 T4 T5
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With C1&#8230;C5 being node-containers and T1&#8230;T5 are the five windows attached to
</I>&gt;<i> these node-containers.
</I>&gt;<i> Pressing Alt+s would (if you focus for example T1, or rather C1) stack
</I>&gt;<i> all your terminals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If on the other hand you open some terminals, split one leaf and open
</I>&gt;<i> some more, your tree will look like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Workspace
</I>&gt;<i>    /   |      \
</I>&gt;<i>   C1  C2      C3
</I>&gt;<i>   |    |     /  \
</I>&gt;<i>   T1  T2   C4   C5
</I>&gt;<i>             |    |
</I>&gt;<i>            T4   T5
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now if you focus C4 or C5 and press Mod+s, you will get a workspace with
</I>&gt;<i> two terminals visible (T1/T2) and one stacked container (C3), containing
</I>&gt;<i> two terminals (T4/T5).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If on the other hand you focus C1 ore C2 and press Mod+s, you will get a
</I>&gt;<i> stacked workspace and can cycle between T1, T2 and (T4+T5).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One small warning: I think near the top of the container-tree (at the
</I>&gt;<i> workspace-level and above) there is some special-casing regarding this,
</I>&gt;<i> because you cannot sensibly &#8222;stack&#8220; workspaces. So if you try focusing
</I>&gt;<i> an entire workspace (via focus parent) you just might get unexpected
</I>&gt;<i> results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I hope I could make at least some things more clear. Maybe I
</I>&gt;<i> confused you even more, in that case &#8222;sorry&#8220; ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Axel
