</I>&gt;<i> would work too. Maybe the names are case insensitive?
</I>
Maybe they are, though the documentation indicates that you need to use
the key symbols that are being produced.

&gt;&gt;<i> This shows throughout the default configuration file.  The documentation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> says:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ,---- [ <A HREF="http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#keybindings">http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#keybindings</A>]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | A keysym (key symbol) is a description for a specific symbol, like &quot;a&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | or &quot;b&quot;, but also more strange ones like &quot;underscore&quot; instead of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | &quot;_&quot;. These are the ones you use in Xmodmap to remap your keys. To get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | the current mapping of your keys, use xmodmap -pke. To interactively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | enter a key and see what keysym it is configured to, use xev.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> `----
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have been using xev to verify that pressing 'AltGr+&lt;Minus Key&gt;' and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'AltGr+Shift+&lt;Minus Key&gt;' do yield 'periodcentered' and 'abovedot',
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> respectively.  (Those are now intercepted by i3.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think so, but I may be wrong.
</I>
Those symbols aren't typed anymore when I press the keys, so yes,
really, i3 must be intercepting them.

&gt;<i> If it was as you say, you could write
</I>&gt;<i> &#8222;
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym abovedot workspace prev
</I>&gt;<i> &#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &#8222;
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym $mod+Shift+minus workspace prev
</I>&gt;<i> &#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> To be honest, I haven't checked if the former works.
</I>&gt;<i> You can do it as an exercise and let me know if you succeed. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be surprised, but I don't say it's impossible.
</I>
That's an interesting idea indeed :)  I tried it and it doesn't work.

&gt;&gt;<i> Actually, 'Shift+&lt;Minus Key&gt;' produces an underscore.  How come that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'AltGr+Shift+minus' even works?  Shouldn't that rather be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'AltGr+Shift+underscore'?[1]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think i3 maps keysyms (&#8222;plain&#8221; keysyms &#8212; without modifiers)
</I>&gt;<i> to keycodes and applies modifiers itself.
</I>
Going by the documentation, the key codes seem to be irrelevant unless
you use 'bindcode' instead of 'bindsym'.  I guess if I changed my
xmodmap so that '-' (minus) is on the key that's labeled 'J', I'd have
to press AltGr+j instead of AltGr+&lt;minus&gt;.

This is pretty confusing ...

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; As a side note, I don't think using AltGr as a modifier is a good idea&#8230;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How come you think so?  It works great and allows for some easy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one-handed i3-operations.  Since I have modified my xmodmap so that I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can type braces and brackets without pressing AltGr, there are only four
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keys that come to mind for which I need AltGr: '@', '|', '&#223;' and '\'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That leaves me pretty much all of the other 98 keys to bind i3 stuff to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :)  Do you know of any application which would be aware that there's such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a thing as an AltGr key?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How about '&#246;'? ;-P
</I>
What about it?

&gt;<i> You are right. It seems good in you case. I use the Colemak keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> layout, which uses AltGr heavily for diacritics input, and there's
</I>&gt;<i> quite many of them in Polish.
</I>
Ah I only write English and German, so I'm not missing any letters with
the keyboard as is.  The only thing is that there are some like '/', '~'
and brackets that are at very inconvenient locations with a default
German layout, so I changed that.

&gt;<i> As for AltGr-aware applications, probably some old games may use that
</I>&gt;<i> key.
</I>
Hm, none that does comes to mind ...

&gt;&gt;<i> (I'm using a Model M keyboard that doesn't have the obsolete keys newer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ones have, so there aren't any keys around Space, Alt, AltGr and Ctrl
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that would get persistently in the way.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have plenty of &#8222;obsolete&#8221; keys on my TypeMatrix 2020,
</I>&gt;<i> such as Super (captioned &#8222;Start&#8221;), which I use for i3's bindings,
</I>&gt;<i> or Caps Lock, which I have bound a minus to. ;-)
</I>
That looks like an interesting keyboard :)  I wish I could have one with
122 keys, but it seems that there are hardware issues preventing that.
