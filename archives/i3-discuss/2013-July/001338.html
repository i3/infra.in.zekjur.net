<PRE>Hi,

In the past, I have sometimes ordered i3 t-shirts in batches and then
sent them to everybody who wanted one.

The local small business that has been making the i3 t-shirts is called
FredDruck, and they now have an online shop where one can order shirts!

The bad news is that the shop is in German only (but they ship
world-wide), and they don&#8217;t have the capacity to make the shop English
anytime soon.

I therefore had the idea that we could have a document on the i3 website
that explains what the terms and conditions are (e.g. how much the
shipping costs, what payment options are available, what the sizes mean,
what goes into which field in the order form) and then link to the shop.

To find out with what exactly people from different countries have
trouble with, a few orders have to be carefully observed and the
document has to be refined repeatedly.

This is a great opportunity for one of you to help the i3 community:
I am looking for somebody who can speak German and is willing to guide
non-Germans through the ordering process while writing and improving a
document which explains this.

Are you interested? Please let me know (cc the mailing list) and we can
discuss the details.

Thanks!

Best regards,
Michael
