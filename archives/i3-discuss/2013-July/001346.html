We would have to figure out what different sizes in different countries
mean.  The USA apparently use (slightly?) different numbers for sizes
than GB does, and both are different from what is used in Germany, afaik
even when you use US sizes in Germany.  There also seems to be a
considerable variety as to what sizes like XL or XXL in the US mean, and
iirc, a size in England can be different from the same size in Scotland.

Further countries might be different again.  It would probably be nice
for the document to include some sort of conversion table --- that
information is probably rather difficult to come by, though.

How many different sizes do they make?
