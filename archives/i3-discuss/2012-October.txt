Things I noticed:

? why do the input fields become red when focused? (I believe it?s  to 
indicate that the input is wrong, but it still feels strange to be told 
?you are wrong? right away)
? The logfile page could simply mention ?i3-dump-log | gzip -9c > 
/tmp/i3.log.gz? and link to the debugging page under "More info" or so, 
since that?s the one command needed. Downside is that people might not 
learn about how to obtain backtraces by chance.
? I always write the bug reports first, and then the title because I 
made up my mind/organized my thoughts. For me, this usually results in 
a more concise title. You could try to move the title down as well, but 
call it ?Summary? so it?s not so awkward.

Yes, it?s to indicate that they are required and you haven?t filled in
anything yet. That?s the default behavior of bootstrap, so if you care,
please send a patch against bootstrap?s css.

Unfortunately, we cannot do that. i3-dump-log only works in debug
versions of i3, not in the release version (intentionally). A proper
error message which explains this in clear terms has been added in i3
v4.3, but that version is too new to assume that everybody has it
(granted, we do only support 4.3, but people might lie about the version
because they?re annoyed by the form, so let?s give it some time).

Interesting idea. Are there any other opinions on that? I?m inclined to
call the field "one-line summary" and move it to the bottom, unless
someone comes up with a good reason against that.

Subject: [i3] Ticket #807
Message-ID: <CANxNxiD5tRTw9sTuFkD_yPiqw8yfNwz=ji3OOt66LgbJEAE1aA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,
I'd like to provide a patch for this ticket (
http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/807 ) but before I get started I'd like
to ask a couple of questions to start in the right direction.
I'm thinking about doing something like a scratchpad toggle which will
show/hide all scratchpad windows at once. This won't work on "all floating
windows" by default but on "all scratchpad windows". A window set to the
scratchpad is centered and resized the first time but not on future
"scratchpad show"s. So it's pretty easy to get the scratchpad windows
showing like you want and then toggle their visibility.
I think this is a good approach but I'm not sure. If this should work on
all the workspace floating windows, how can we distinguish the floating
windows being send to the scratchpad from windows already in the scratchpad?

So my questions are:
1) Is this the right approach?
2) If so, should the new command handle matching windows? (ie: bindsym
Mod1+Control+- [class="URxvt"] scratchpad toggle )


Rgds,
Marcos

I think the approach you described has nothing to do with the ticket
itself. Ticket #807 is about floating windows, and that feature was
accepted. If you care about scratchpad windows, please file a new ticket
and I?ll think about it.

Ok, Since the ticket mentioned how to accomplish something similar for
scratchpad windows with focus changing I thought that was the case, which I
care more than hiding regular floating windows since most of the time my
floating windows are temporary and most of my scrachpad windows are not
Here's the ticket http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/834

Subject: [i3] Workspace 1 does not respect tabbed layout setting
Message-ID: <m2obklb70o.fsf@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>

I have found a regression in i3.  I run i3 on OS X 10.8.2 and XQuartz
2.7.4.  In my configuration, I have:

  workspace_layout tabbed

However, when I start a fresh i3 version 4.3-19-g01ce4bb (2012-09-29,
branch "master"), i3 does not seem to be respect the workspace_layout
setting.  When I open two terminals, they are not presented in tabbed
layout, but instead in splith:

+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| terminal 1                | terminal 2                |
+---------------------------+---------------------------+
|                           |                           |
|                           |                           |
|                           |                           | 

The problem only occurs in workspace 1, however.  When I switch to
another workspace, say workspace 2, and I open two terminals, they are
tabbed as I would expect them to be:

+---------------------------+---------------------------+
| terminal 1                | terminal 2                |
+---------------------------+---------------------------+
|                                                       |
|                                                       |
|                                                       | 

Interestingly, when I close all the windows in workspace 1, switch to
workspace 2, open two windows, then switch back to workspace 1 and open
two windows there, then they are tabbed as well.  So, workspace 1
realizes that it should use the tabbed layout only after I've used it
successfully in workspace 2.

It seems that this problem was introduced recently.  When I run i3-4.2
everything works as I expect it to work.  The release version of i3-4.3
has the problem as well as today's HEAD of the git repository.

(Unfortunately I am not able to provide more debugging information,
i3-dump-log seems not to work on OS X.  i3-dump-log: Could not shm_open
SHM segment for the i3 log (/i3-log-32571): No such file or directory).

Any ideas what could be the cause of my problem?  I am happy to provide
more information or test out things if needed.

Thanks,

I tried, but the after submitting the first form I see:

  New i3 ticket: Internal error

  There was an internal error in i3-new-ticket. Your data has been saved
  in a crash report and the developers have been notified via email. A
  ticket with the data you submitted will be created manually.

  The error message of the program is:

I've tried it twice, both times with the same result.

Thanks, this helped me fix (or rather work around) the issue. See

the details.

Could you please retry now (hopefully the last time)? :-)

Hi,

I think Marcus hasn't created the bug report yet
(or I just haven't found it) so I'm posting this here.

I git bisected the problem to this commit:
    cd4dd365e87ea3ea09cde9cd8a00209284dc282d
    Allow changing the layout of workspaces by storing it (Thanks mhcerri)

A proposed patch is attached. It explicitly sets workspace_layout in
create_workspace_on_output(). I'm still confused why this issue only
occurs on the initial workspaces after starting i3, though. So I'm not
100% sure whether this is the correct way to fix this.

A testcase is also included.

Greetings,
Sascha

Are you sure? The shm_open(2) manpage on Mac OS X 10.6.8 says otherwise:

     The value of oflag is formed by or'ing the following values:

           O_RDONLY        open for reading only
           O_RDWR          open for reading and writing
           O_CREAT         create object if it does not exist
           O_EXCL          error if create and object exists
           O_TRUNC         truncate size to 0

     Exactly one of O_RDONLY or O_RDWR must be specified.

     If O_TRUNC is specified and the file exists, the file is truncated
     to zero length.  If O_EXCL is set with O_CREAT and the file already
     exists, shm_open() returns an error.  This may be used to implement
     a simple exclusive access locking mechanism.

Did they break this in newer versions or is your patch wrong?

O_TRUNK is documented and exists but it is not implemented.  shm_open
with O_TRUNK yields

  shm_open: invalid argument

AFAIK, O_TRUNK never worked on OS X.

Hi Marcus,

I fixed this by just removing the O_TRUNC flag entirely. Since we
truncate and memset afterwards anyways, there is no reason to use
O_TRUNC.

Subject: [i3] firefox stealing focus on startup
Message-ID: <5013.1349368659@thecus.kiddle.eu>

When starting up, firefox likes to grab focus once it has started. As it
can take more than a couple of seconds to start and I have it assigned
to a particular workspace, this can be quite annoying. I don't see a
need for anything to grab focus ever. Is there any way to have such
focus grabbing hints treated in the same way as an urgency hint instead.

Thanks

Oliver

It should only be able to grab focus when it?s on a visible
workspace. If it happens when firefox is invisible, that?s not with i3?s
help, so nothing we can do about it.

Maybe this helps, though?

I've got a two monitor setup and assign Firefox to start on one of
them. So it is often on a visible workspace when I start it.

That only helps for the case when I open a URL in an existing firefox
such as by clicking on one in my e-mail. Thanks for the pointer though
as that does help a bit.

For what it's worth, an answer that bypasses your question: 

For most of my browsing tasks, I use dwb
(http://portix.bitbucket.org/dwb/) nowadays. I figured that I prefer 
to have my window manager to take care of window/tab management over
some inconsistent and extraneous implementation. There are
some rough edges with sharing cookies among different instances of
the browser and sharing history etc., but those are most likely
due to part of my lack of interest to configure it correctly. 

Cheers, 


	Joep

Dear all,
I am really enjoying using i3 but there is one feature missing that would make it perfect: a border-less and title-less tabbed layout. Perhaps this could be configurable in a similar way to i3status, where the tab titles are hidden until the modifier is pressed?I would really appreciate it if anyone could tell me if this is a planned feature or give me any hints on what's needed if I chose to dig into the code and implement this myself.Thank you and regards,Daniel

This doesn?t fit the i3 philosophy because the missing titles obscure
the fact that there are multiple windows on your screen.

Therefore, we won?t introduce such a feature.

The only general advice I can give is read the hacking-howto. And maybe
spend some time with i3 as-is and see if you really really can?t adapt
to how things are before you try to modify them ;-).

Hi folks,

consider following layout: I've opened two windows, made the last window a split
container and then opened a 3rd window, leaving me with something like this:

  -------------------
  |       |    2    |
  |   1   |________ |
  |       |    3    |
  |       |         |
  -------------------

Consider further that I'm done with window 3, so I close it. What I now would
like to do is tell window 2 "Don't be a split container anymore!", so when I
open a new 3rd window, the 3 windows are all directly in the same container (
e.g. |1|2|3|). The only way I've found so far to do this is moving window 2
around. Is there any other way?

Hello Tobias,

if i understand you right, you want to focus the parent of window 2 and 
then create a new window?

This looks to me like yet another case in which something like mod+shift+a ("Move to Parent") would me useful.

Not really, it's more like moving window 2 out of its own container into its parent, so that I
don't have to focus the parent.

Yeah, that would be helpful, is there a way to do this?

Hi,
Daniel, if you decide to implement this feature, please do so also for the
stacked layout. It would really save some of my screen estate. I tend to
have
a screen divided into two parts where each part consists of multiple
stacked
windows. Sometimes titles take up to 1/4 of my screen height. I was
thinking of extending possibility to change border style to stacked and
tabbed
layout, but your suggestion would also help a lot.

Cheers,
Piotr

Hello,

I'm trying to build the latest version of i3 on FreeBSD since the port
has not been updated yet, and I get the following error when building.

[i3] YACC src/cfgparse.y
[i3] CC src/cfgparse.tab.c
[i3] LEX src/cfgparse.l
flex: can't open src/cfgparse.yy.c
gmake: *** [src/cfgparse.yy.c] Error 1

Just because it can been done, does not mean it should be done.

FreeBSD?s base system flex or bison or both is really old. Use the one
from ports.

Thanks for the reply.

At first I thought that was the issues, I have 

flex 2.5.37
bison 2.5.1

Both of which are higher than the DEPENDS document...I thought maybe I
should downgrade them?

Are you sure that those are actually used when compiling?

FYI: I use flex 2.5.35 and bison 2.5.

I?d recommend you to contact the FreeBSD port maintainer or a FreeBSD
mailing list, they should be more knowledgable about problems like this.

Also, as a heads-up: in the next version of i3, we?ll still support the
flex/bison parser but in the version afterwards, it?ll be removed.

You need the ones from ports:

ports/textproc/flex
ports/devel/bison

actually devel/bison is not needed, but textproc/flex is really needed.

If you have a look a the port which is old :( then you'll get the correct
way to build i3 on FreeBSD.

Bapt,

Thanks for the reply. I tried looking at the old port and making the
changes suggested by it to 4.3 but that did not help. Then someone on
the FreeBSD list found the problem, which I quote now:

"The commands that fail are:

flex -i -o src/cfgparse.yy.c ../i3-4.3/src/cfgparse.l
flex -i -o i3-config-wizard/cfgparse.yy.c i3-config-wizard/cfgparse.l

The below commands work:

flex -i -osrc/cfgparse.yy.c ../i3-4.3/src/cfgparse.l
flex -i -oi3-config-wizard/cfgparse.yy.c i3-config-wizard/cfgparse.l"

So once I did that every thing build smoothly. I guess it just one of
those little Linux and FreeBSD differences :)

The port maintainer was CC on the reply with a diff so hopefully the
official port will be updated soon.

Thanks again for the reply,

Rod

So, I?ve just looked at your patch again (sorry for taking so long, I
have a bad habit of delaying unpleasant tasks).

I?ve come to the conclusion that my gut feeling about such a refactoring
just says no. It?s too risky for me to just merge it without
understanding every detail, and in order to to understand everything, I
need to do the changes myself. Simply reading the diff (or trying to
read both versions side-by-side) does not help me in understanding the
changes.

Therefore, I will not merge these patches as they are, sorry for the
work you?ve put into it :-(.

However, I believe your original goal was to implement the smart popup
during fullscreen behavior, which I have now done in commit
http://c.i3wm.org/9b87b2c (without any large refactorings whatsoever).

If there is anything else you intended to accomplish with those patches,
please let me know and we can work out a different solution for that,
too.
