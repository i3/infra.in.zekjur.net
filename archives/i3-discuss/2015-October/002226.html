<PRE>Nice to have such clear remarks from a new  (power)user.

I just wanted to add some clarifications/coments.

</I>&gt;<i>     Hello All!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I just switched from Notion to i3 about a month ago. In general it's
</I>&gt;<i>     been a positive experience, I especially appreciate the smaller
</I>&gt;<i>     configuration file, the more sensible default bindings, the ability to
</I>&gt;<i>     put windows in a tree (if that's the correct word).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     After settling in, I made a quick list of some issues I ran into and
</I>&gt;<i>     wanted to report back to the developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - As a user of the Dvorak keyboard layout, I was confused by the
</I>&gt;<i>       result of running i3-config-wizard. I can see how h,t,n,s could be
</I>&gt;<i>       used for navigation, but many of the remaining key bindings don't
</I>&gt;<i>       make sense - why should 'd' split horizontally, or 'p' restart? This
</I>&gt;<i>       wasn't really explained to me through the process of installing and
</I>&gt;<i>       trying out the software. I ended up having to revert most of the
</I>&gt;<i>       bindings to the Qwerty defaults. I think the wizard made things more
</I>&gt;<i>       difficult in the end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key _positions_ make some sense, the key mnemonics likely don’t. I 
</I>&gt;<i> don’t think this is a big problem, as users are very likely to change 
</I>&gt;<i> their config file anyway. Also, you’re free to use/not use the wizard 
</I>&gt;<i> as you see fit — for most users, using the wizard seems to be the best 
</I>&gt;<i> solution, which is why it’s started by default.
</I>It is always difficult to mix the key positions and values and to pipck 
reasonable defaults.
On azerty, I want to use hjkl for navigation, but then h is no more 
available for &quot;horizontal split&quot;.

Also, it is easier to have the same bindings on all installations, even 
if misplaced.
This way, the tutorials can assume that the users all have Mod+p for 
restart.
If you are experienced enough to change the default bindings, then you 
are experienced enough to transpose the tutorials :-)

As usual, ideas on improving the bindings are welcome.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Coming from Notion, I would have expected the default window layout
</I>&gt;<i>       to be tabbed. At first I thought that i3 didn't support a tabbed
</I>&gt;<i>       layout, because when I first started it (with killall notion; i3), I
</I>&gt;<i>       ended up with 10 unusably-narrow windows. I still don't know how to
</I>&gt;<i>       make tabbing the default - when I open windows on a new workspace,
</I>&gt;<i>       they always come up split. If I kill and restart i3, then everything
</I>&gt;<i>       comes up split (and uselessly narrow).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does “workspace_layout tabbed” do what you want?
</I>Also, killing then starting i3 is not a common operation.
You might prefer reload and/or restart as they preserve the layout.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - I had to ask the IRC channel for the name of the key binding to turn
</I>&gt;<i>       a dialog box into a window - perhaps the documentation should be
</I>&gt;<i>       improved so new users can avoid this hurdle (e.g. under TERMINOLOGY
</I>&gt;<i>       in the man page, there could be an entry explaining that a &quot;Floating
</I>&gt;<i>       Window&quot; is something like a dialog box).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you please send a pull request for <A HREF="https://github.com/i3/i3">https://github.com/i3/i3</A> which 
</I>&gt;<i> adds an explanation where you think it makes sense?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Even after learning the &quot;floating toggle&quot; binding it sometimes
</I>&gt;<i>       becomes annoying or confusing to have to press it each time - for
</I>&gt;<i>       instance if I have to print a lot of stuff in Firefox, but I
</I>&gt;<i>       sometimes want to navigate to other windows when the print dialog is
</I>&gt;<i>       open. I also sometimes accidentally turn Firefox into a floating
</I>&gt;<i>       window when I'm doing this, and then I wonder where all the other
</I>&gt;<i>       windows went.... I would appreciate an option to have dialogs always
</I>&gt;<i>       come up as windows by default.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the print dialog is clearly meant to be floating, Firefox should 
</I>&gt;<i> set the appropriate window hints. Since you describe you have to 
</I>&gt;<i> manually make it floating, apparently Firefox doesn’t. You should file 
</I>&gt;<i> a Firefox bug, but you can work around this with a for_window rule, 
</I>&gt;<i> see 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_arbitrary_commands_for_specific_windows_for_window">http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_arbitrary_commands_for_specific_windows_for_window</A>
</I>i3 tries to be smart about which windows to keep floating.
Basically, every window that specifically asks to be floating is kept 
floating.

If you want a drastic solution, add

for_window [title=&quot;.*&quot;] floating disable

My config tends to add floating windows :

for_window [title=&quot;Oz Browser&quot;]       floating enable
for_window [title=&quot;Super Hexagon&quot;]    floating enable
for_window [title=&quot;^SpaceChem$&quot;]      floating enable
for_window [class=&quot;Gnuplot&quot;]          floating enable
for_window [class=&quot;FLTK&quot;]             floating enable
#for_window [class=&quot;Graphviz&quot;]         floating enable
for_window [window_role=&quot;CallWindow&quot;] floating enable

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - &quot;focus right&quot; is not always the reverse of &quot;focus left&quot;. For
</I>&gt;<i>       instance, if the rightmost tab is split horizontally, then one
</I>&gt;<i>       command will cycle through all the windows, but the other will get
</I>&gt;<i>       stuck cycling through the children of the tab which has been split.
</I>&gt;<i>       Same with &quot;focus up&quot; and &quot;focus down&quot; in the stacking layout, when a
</I>&gt;<i>       child is split vertically. It seems it would be cleaner to have
</I>&gt;<i>       these pairs be strict opposites.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are several places where the directional commands don’t strictly 
</I>&gt;<i> operate on the tree and hence focus left/right are not always direct 
</I>&gt;<i> opposites. We believe that bottomline, this makes it easier for users. 
</I>&gt;<i> Even if it didn’t make it easier for users, changing it now would be 
</I>&gt;<i> very disruptive to existing users, so I don’t think we can do much 
</I>&gt;<i> about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you feel strongly, you might be able to implement your own logic 
</I>&gt;<i> using the IPC interface: <A HREF="http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html">http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html</A>
</I>This works much like commant completion in zsh for example.
The right arrow cycles only on the last line of completions.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - I like that &quot;i3-nagbar&quot; is available to display error messages, but
</I>&gt;<i>       I don't know how to close it with my keyboard... seems like I have
</I>&gt;<i>       to use my mouse to close it. I'd prefer to avoid the mouse...!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It’s designed to nag you, so this is working as intended :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Well, I hope this isn't too much stuff at once. I'm happy with i3 so
</I>&gt;<i>     even if you don't fix any of these problems, I'll still use it. As I
</I>&gt;<i>     mentioned above, I just wanted to report back since it's not always
</I>&gt;<i>     easy to anticipate how new users will experience a piece of software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Thanks for all your hard work in developing i3!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Best wishes,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Frederik
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
