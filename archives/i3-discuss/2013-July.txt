HI,

I'm pretty sure that i3status isn't able to show how fast the fans in
the computer are running, or even if it is supposed to support that.
But does anyone know a solution for it that someone has created using
python or scripts?

I will start to work on that for me if no one has made that yet.

Thanks and best regards.
Marcelo

On solution: Replace i3status with conky.

Feel free to modify or take for an example what you find on [1].  Conky
seems to be a somewhat large application for just displaying some fan
speeds.

Hi,

what might be the reason for the following key bindings in the config to
be ignored:


bind $mod+periodcentered workspace next
bind $mod+Shift+abovedot workspace prev


$mod is AltGr, and I have


keycode  61 = minus underscore minus underscore periodcentered abovedot periodcentered


in my xmodmap.  I can type these symbols just fine, as if i3 is totally
ignoring these key bindings.

You need to use bindsym instead of bind in this case.

Thank you --- I tried that and these key bindings are still ignored.

bindsym $mod+periodcentered workspace next
bindsym $mod+Shift+abovedot workspace prev

Do I need to make a bug report with a logfile attached to it?

In case you decide to file a bug, yes, a logfile with maximum debug

I'd try with:
?
bindsym $mod+minus workspace next
bindsym $mod+Shift+minus workspace prev
?
in this case.
As a side note, I don't think using AltGr as a modifier is a good idea?

Message-ID: <CAHiy0bRakfm86TsEL45GVM6Rbq=uoLuP_Myx7ToN+g1FLnC1Lg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have configured my i3, so that all new-window has no border and
new-float border is normal. But then if I change an existing tiling window
to float, it will be border-less.

Relevant part of my confiuration:

...
new_window none
new_float  normal
hide_edge_borders both
...

Is there a way to make float window always have border and tiling window
without one?

Instead of using

    bindsym $mod+x floating enable

Use:

    bindsym $mod+x floating enable; border normal

unless I create another binding to make it borderless, like "bindsym $mod+y
floating disable; border none ".  It is a little bit cumbersome as it needs
two key bindings.  Anyway, it solves my current problem.  It would be
better if the floating toggle command could have the same effect.

Message-ID: <20130710143035.39554@relay.ibs.dn.ua>

Hi,

I have a couple of questions, please:

1. is it possible (I think this time it is not) to configure i3 to set
   different charset layout for windows?

   what I mean is when I work in bilingual environment (lets say `en'
   and `ru' and `en' I want to be the default one), to switch charset
   globally is rather inconvenient, so it'd be great to be able to set
   charset individually for each window

2. and adjacent question: wouldn't it be nice to be able to see on
   status bar, which charset is active? is it possible?

what do you think, please?

Let me ask the question the other way around:

Is it possible to have per-window locales/charsets? Not that I know of, but I
might be wrong.

> 2. and adjacent question: wouldn't it be nice to be able to see on
>    status bar, which charset is active? is it possible?
With a wrapper script around i3status (or whichever status program you
are using), anything is possible. If you are asking whether i3status
could be extended to show the current locale/charset, the answer is no.

Subject: [i3] Want to help? Become our t-shirt manager!
Message-ID: <x6wqoytev2.fsf@midna.lan>

Hi,

In the past, I have sometimes ordered i3 t-shirts in batches and then
sent them to everybody who wanted one.

The local small business that has been making the i3 t-shirts is called
FredDruck, and they now have an online shop where one can order shirts!

The bad news is that the shop is in German only (but they ship
world-wide), and they don?t have the capacity to make the shop English
anytime soon.

I therefore had the idea that we could have a document on the i3 website
that explains what the terms and conditions are (e.g. how much the
shipping costs, what payment options are available, what the sizes mean,
what goes into which field in the order form) and then link to the shop.

To find out with what exactly people from different countries have
trouble with, a few orders have to be carefully observed and the
document has to be refined repeatedly.

This is a great opportunity for one of you to help the i3 community:
I am looking for somebody who can speak German and is willing to guide
non-Germans through the ordering process while writing and improving a
document which explains this.

Are you interested? Please let me know (cc the mailing list) and we can
discuss the details.

Thanks!

yes, for example ubuntu provides that (perhaps it is gnome)

what I meant is not *any* charset but the one from preconfigured in xorg
(when I have to use ubuntu, I work on bilingual configuration with en
default and ru as secondary)

may you point me, where it is described, please

I was asking, if it is possible to include the issue into i3status todo?

Because without this fearure it is rather inconvenient to type several
characters and erase them right away because them were of wrong charset

of course, it is possible to install some external layout switcher which
can place it's icon into the tray, but it looks rather artificial in
comparison with just placing some character/s on i3status ... am I
wrong?

A quick googling showed that there are different daemons like xxkb and
kbdd doing exactly that. I.e. it has nothing to do with i3.

Further, if you don't want yet-another-daemon, X itself provides a way
to toggle keybindings with one single key (I for example have bound it
to the 'menu' key, as it is completely useless else): the 'grp'
XkbOptions. In my case in the xorg.conf there is:

Option "XkbOptions"
"terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp,grp:menu_toggle,compose:rwin,caps:escape"

I was talking about the posibility to have individual charset for each
window and I really can not see the cause why it couldn't be i3 business

Where it is implemented, the work is much comfortable (try to imagine
situation with three or more locales)

Just to avoid confusion: What exactly do you mean by 'charset'? I
figured you ment 'keyboard layout', and this is what I answered.

If you really mean 'charset' as in 'fonts' and 'display text', I can
only say: Unicode (and UTF-8) is there for a reason.

We would have to figure out what different sizes in different countries
mean.  The USA apparently use (slightly?) different numbers for sizes
than GB does, and both are different from what is used in Germany, afaik
even when you use US sizes in Germany.  There also seems to be a
considerable variety as to what sizes like XL or XXL in the US mean, and
iirc, a size in England can be different from the same size in Scotland.

Further countries might be different again.  It would probably be nice
for the document to include some sort of conversion table --- that
information is probably rather difficult to come by, though.

How many different sizes do they make?

Oh thank you!  That works perfectly!

My understanding was that you need to use the actual key symbol (as used
in xmodmap) that is being produced.  For example, when you have

bindsym $mod+Shift+J move left

a capital 'J' is being produced.  When you have the some binding without
Shift, like

bindsym $mod+j move left

it's a small 'j' because Shift isn't pressed.

This shows throughout the default configuration file.  The documentation
says:


,---- [ http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#keybindings]
|
| A keysym (key symbol) is a description for a specific symbol, like "a"
| or "b", but also more strange ones like "underscore" instead of
| "_". These are the ones you use in Xmodmap to remap your keys. To get
| the current mapping of your keys, use xmodmap -pke. To interactively
| enter a key and see what keysym it is configured to, use xev.
|
`----


I have been using xev to verify that pressing 'AltGr+<Minus Key>' and
'AltGr+Shift+<Minus Key>' do yield 'periodcentered' and 'abovedot',
respectively.  (Those are now intercepted by i3.)

Actually, 'Shift+<Minus Key>' produces an underscore.  How come that
'AltGr+Shift+minus' even works?  Shouldn't that rather be
'AltGr+Shift+underscore'?[1]

Is the documentation misleading, or is there some inconsistency with how
i3 perceives (some) keystrokes or key symbols?

    XLookupString gives 1 bytes: (2d) "-"
    XFilterEvent returns: False

keycode  61 = minus underscore minus underscore periodcentered abovedot periodcentered


> As a side note, I don't think using AltGr as a modifier is a good idea?

How come you think so?  It works great and allows for some easy
one-handed i3-operations.  Since I have modified my xmodmap so that I
can type braces and brackets without pressing AltGr, there are only four
keys that come to mind for which I need AltGr: '@', '|', '?' and '\'.
That leaves me pretty much all of the other 98 keys to bind i3 stuff to
:)  Do you know of any application which would be aware that there's such
a thing as an AltGr key?

(I'm using a Model M keyboard that doesn't have the obsolete keys newer
ones have, so there aren't any keys around Space, Alt, AltGr and Ctrl
that would get persistently in the way.)

If there was some sort of "window switching hook" that could be used to
execute a command and which would be called by i3 when focus changes,
users could set up something to switch keyboard layouts depending on
which window has the focus.  I'm thinking of something similar to the
'for_window' option along the lines of:


focused_window [title=".*"] exec xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap-std
focused_window [title="ru"] exec xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap-ru
focused_window [title="emacs"] exec xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap-programming


However, it might be difficult to sufficiently differentiate the windows
with only the criteria that are currently available.


It is easily possible to have different locale in different windows. You
can always set environment variables like 'LANG' and 'LC_MESSAGES'
before starting an application.  That probably goes for every
application, the only requirement being that the given locale is (and
translations for the app are) available on the system.

Could anybody explain to me, why the proposed solution (using xxkb or
kbdd) ist not feasible? I mean: This is just the usecase they were
intended for...

no, nobody can, since it is the proposed solution isn't not feasible. It
is just what I didn't asked about.

if i3 says, the issue is not i3's deal, so, let it be

may be you Ren?, right and using external tool is better than repeat
the functionality in i3/i3something code

anyway thanks

?
bindsym $mod+Shift+j move left
?
would work too. Maybe the names are case insensitive?

I don't think so, but I may be wrong.
If it was as you say, you could write
?
bindsym abovedot workspace prev
?
instead of
?
bindsym $mod+Shift+minus workspace prev
?
To be honest, I haven't checked if the former works.
You can do it as an exercise and let me know if you succeed. ;-)
I'd be surprised, but I don't say it's impossible.

I think i3 maps keysyms (?plain? keysyms ? without modifiers)
to keycodes and applies modifiers itself.

How about '?'? ;-P
You are right. It seems good in you case.
I use the Colemak keyboard layout, which uses AltGr heavily
for diacritics input, and there's quite many of them in Polish.

As for AltGr-aware applications, probably
some old games may use that key.

I have plenty of ?obsolete? keys on my TypeMatrix 2020,
such as Super (captioned ?Start?), which I use for i3's bindings,
or Caps Lock, which I have bound a minus to. ;-)

I would be willing to assist. Since I am German and live in the US I could 
also provide information about different sizes/units.

Maybe they are, though the documentation indicates that you need to use
the key symbols that are being produced.

Those symbols aren't typed anymore when I press the keys, so yes,
really, i3 must be intercepting them.

That's an interesting idea indeed :)  I tried it and it doesn't work.

Going by the documentation, the key codes seem to be irrelevant unless
you use 'bindcode' instead of 'bindsym'.  I guess if I changed my
xmodmap so that '-' (minus) is on the key that's labeled 'J', I'd have
to press AltGr+j instead of AltGr+<minus>.

This is pretty confusing ...

What about it?

Ah I only write English and German, so I'm not missing any letters with
the keyboard as is.  The only thing is that there are some like '/', '~'
and brackets that are at very inconvenient locations with a default
German layout, so I changed that.

That looks like an interesting keyboard :)  I wish I could have one with
122 keys, but it seems that there are hardware issues preventing that.

It was just an idea; I don't know what the proposed tools do.  Since the
WM knows which window is focused, it seems to make at least as much
sense to have such hooks for whatever usage as it does to be able to
bind various things to keys.

Oh I wasn't sure if a bug report would be required :)

You've probably seen that it's working now.  Some clarification would be
nice, though; I might be able to write a paragraph or two then which
could be added to the documentation.  Doing that now would be too much
guessing about how these key bindings work.

It does not state if the keys should be produced with
or without modifiers. I agree this may need clarification.

It is hard to follow the thread because I don?t have very fresh memory
on this part of the code and it?s a complex subject.

I?d recommend reading
http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/tree/src/config.c?h=next#n111
which explains much better than I ever could how it works.

Note that X11 thinks in keycodes, not in keysyms. I.e., what you get in
xev is only what libX11 makes of the keycodes it gets.

Sorry for not being very helpful here. Some research on your part and
documentation updates are appreciated, though.

Subject: [i3] Containers in i3
Message-ID: <CACxDzD+TAd6p_dfckxpQDBrTXV5rws=OnvpHhsJAPLdLN5DLxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello. I'm new to this list. Recently I've gotten interested in tiling
window managers, and I studied the excellent reviews of more than 30
at the Crunchbang Wiki
[http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=18273] and elsewhere,
and I've tried out i3, awesome, and xmonad, and I think i3 is the one
for me. I've watched all the videos on i3 available at YouTbue
(including the one on tree structure and containers), and studied the
User Guide, but I'm a very literal-minded mathematician and I'm still
having problems with understanding and using the concept of
containers. I have three questions (in order of abstractness).

(1) I'm sitting in front of an i3-screen with a focused window. I want
to know (preferably in a semi-algorithmic statement), if I press Mod +
s, exactly which windows will be stacked. In particular, does the
answer depend on the history of the focused window?

(2) If I press mod+v and make some windows, are they all in the same
container? If I now press mod+h and make some more windows, are they
in a different container?

(3) I just don't grasp the concept of a container in i3. It seems to
me that the basic objects are windows, and that "container" is a
derived, relational notion, namely: two windows may (or may not) be in
the same container. [So, mathematically, I think of a container as an
equivalence class of windows; but I don't know what the equivalence
relation is.]

Thank you for your patience.

Hi,

Excerpts from Harry Allenby's message of 2013-07-15 07:50:39 +0200:
> I'm a very literal-minded mathematician

Then let me, as a fellow mathematician try to explain at least part of
your questions ;)

> (3) I just don't grasp the concept of a container in i3. It seems to

Mathematically it is pretty simple. Containers are nodes in a tree,
whose root the X-root-window is. Children of this root level there are
individual outputs, children of the outputs are the workspaces, whose
children in turn are the container-trees containing the windows you see.

A container can either be an inner node containing more containers (I
think this is called a ?split-container? in the documentation), or it
can be a leaf, containing a window.

The nodes are not all equal, leafs contain windows and near the top of
the hierarchy there has to be special treatment (to use the more
user-friendly abstractions of outputs and workspaces), but mostly this
should be the way to think of it.

> (2) If I press mod+v and make some windows, are they all in the same

> in a different container?

Yes and no. If by ?window? you think of ?a leaf node in the container
tree?, then yes.

If you create some windows (for example pressing Mod+Enter to
open some terminals), then each one is put in an individual container.
These containers are then put in a big container. If you then press
mod+h, the currently focused node in the tree (which would be a leaf in
most cases, so a container having a window inside it) is replaced by a
new container, with the old content as a subtree. If you then open some
windows, they are new leafs which are put in that new container.

So I think the solution here is to stop thinking about windows as
entities in the container-tree, because they're really not. The
container-tree is an abstraction used by i3 and leaf-nodes in this tree
have a window-property attached to them.

> (1) I'm sitting in front of an i3-screen with a focused window. I want

I'm actually not very clear of this myself. It just magically does
exactly what I want. I _think_ the container being stacked is always the
parent of the currently focused container.

So, if you just open a bunch of terminals on an empty workspace, focus
one of them, your layout would be something like (I apologize for my
crude ASCII-art):

      Workspace
    /  |  |  | \
   C1 C2 C3 C4 C5
   |  |  |  |  |
   T1 T2 T3 T4 T5

With C1?C5 being node-containers and T1?T5 are the five windows attached to
these node-containers.
Pressing Alt+s would (if you focus for example T1, or rather C1) stack
all your terminals.

If on the other hand you open some terminals, split one leaf and open
some more, your tree will look like this:

     Workspace
   /   |      \
  C1  C2      C3
  |    |     /  \
  T1  T2   C4   C5
            |    |
           T4   T5

Now if you focus C4 or C5 and press Mod+s, you will get a workspace with
two terminals visible (T1/T2) and one stacked container (C3), containing
two terminals (T4/T5).

If on the other hand you focus C1 ore C2 and press Mod+s, you will get a
stacked workspace and can cycle between T1, T2 and (T4+T5).

One small warning: I think near the top of the container-tree (at the
workspace-level and above) there is some special-casing regarding this,
because you cannot sensibly ?stack? workspaces. So if you try focusing
an entire workspace (via focus parent) you just might get unexpected
results.


So, I hope I could make at least some things more clear. Maybe I
confused you even more, in that case ?sorry? ;)

Kind regards,

Axel

Thanks very much for your detailed answer! I will study it carefully and
make some experiments and maybe come up with a tree-model I can understand
better--something I love doing. I like i3 very much because:
(1) trees are IMO a better starting point than the column models others use;
(2) I hate having to go through the pre-designed layouts given to you by
some others (e.g. awesome and xmonad) (in the Microsoft spirit of "We know
what's best for you").
So I'm glad i3 has surprises! (I think the tragedy of doing mathematics is
that you start with something totally magical, and you put in a lot of
thought and work to understand it; and if you succeed you destroy its magic
(but not totally!).)

Subject: [i3] Ratio for split containers ?
Message-ID: <CAGfU=hfE4U8Ao2_++D8msY6xdzvOFdtpTey97vTy2SM4HmL0MA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

after reading i3 docs I'm still cann't get how to change default i3 ratio
for splitted containers.

By default containers are split 50/50 of the available workspace and I have
to invoke "resize" mode, adjust the size then leave back to "normal" mode.
Bit cumbersome. I'd need to set default "golden" ratio of 67%/33% for split
containers. Is this possible in i3 ?


Regards

No. You could try implementing this as a little script, see
http://i3wm.org/docs/ipc.html

Subject: [i3] Making Hangouts to minimize
Message-ID: <CAHCiste3S6f1Y2AtDNv1hgmUWEo6xPug603jgZTy2NGSUp3+Yw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using the hangout plugin for pidgin and similar. On a stacking WM, the
plugin will be shown minimizable icons on the titilebar. in i3 the icons
are not shown at all.

Being a popup, the hangouts is always on top, so without the minimize
button its actually impossible to work.

I would like to know if someone is using the same and have a way around
this.

Thanks

Hi,

When I work with Skype, I set the messaging (= text exchange) window as 
floating,
and send it to the scratchpad. When new text arrives, there is a bell 
ringing and
I call the window back from the scratchpat to answer.

The video window is always on top, but that is for the best.

So I think the scratchpad might be a solution for you.

Regards,
Guillaume.

Subject: [i3] Move container via $mod+shift+F12
Message-ID: <51F5173D.7080200@cookiesoft.de>

Hi everyone,

I have a real strange behavoir.
When I try to move a container to workspace 12 via shortcut below, it
won't work. But going to workspace 12 (not moving a container) is fine.
Is that a bug? Did I do something wrong?
> bindsym $mod+F12 workspace 12
works
> bindsym $mod+Shift+F12 move container to workspace 12
won't work






Regards
Marcel

My guess is that either Shift+F12 does not generate a KeyPress event on
your computer due to the firmware grabbing the key for something else or
another application grabbing it.

Checking the i3 log will reveal whether it detects a key press, see also
http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html

There are no known bugs with regards to key grabbing that would fit what
you are seeing and in the past, _all_ of these issues fell into either
of the categories I listed above.

You may be right. Xev does log an key event for Shift+F12, Meta+F12, but
not for Meta+Shift+F12. Any chance to find out what does block the event?
