<PRE>Hello from Greece!We have setup an x2go client on a windows xp pc, and we are trying to establish a connection with an x2go server pc with debian stable and i3 &#160;on it. While it seems that the connection is established between the client and the server, the i3 gui pop-up on the client screen for a second or two, but then it close. The log file with the error is the following:
