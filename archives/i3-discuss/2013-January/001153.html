<PRE>Hi,

I'm not too fond of this binary tree idea: It has no real gain (at least 
not for me), as it can't do anything one could not achieve with a single 
keystroke before opening a new window. (i.e. switching to splitv / 
splith). But it takes aways some possibilities, for example having more 
than two containers each taking the full height.

I also thought about presets, as &quot;presets for workspace layouts&quot; is one 
feature I really miss in i3. What I'd like to have is the following:
My workspace 1 always contains pidgin (left, ~20%) and thunderbird 
(right, rest of screen). I have not yet been able to create a config 
such that when I start those programs (in arbitrary order) they are 
placed as described.
I guess it'd need some kind of &quot;want have&quot;-size, such that when a 
container has the possibility to resize (because a new container 
appeared), it resizes to the &quot;want have&quot;-size (or some intermediate 
values, if multiple &quot;want have&quot;-sizes do not allow for an &quot;optimal&quot; 
placement.
Maybe, we should fork this thread? :-)
