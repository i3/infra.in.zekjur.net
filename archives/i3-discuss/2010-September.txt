Running make I get:

[root at phoenix i3-3.e-bf1]# make clean
Makefile:16: Generating loglevels.h
[root at phoenix i3-3.e-bf1]# make
Makefile:16: Generating loglevels.h

Just in case, I deleted the directory and tried again with the same results.

I ran it with make -j 1, to make sure there were no parallel builds.

My CFLAGS are: -std=c99 -pipe -Wall -Wunused-value -Iinclude
-I/usr/local/include -DI3_VERSION="3.e-bf1 (2010-06-09)" -D_GNU_SOURCE
-gdwarf-2 -g3

Thanks for your quick response.

Well, you should install libev-dev (or similar on RHEL)? See also

Thanks.  I had incorrectly assumed that libev was the same as
libevent.  RedHat often names their packages a little different than
the tarballs.

BTW: make clean install still gets errors, but make clean, then make,
then make install worked without error.

I now have a working i3 in RHEL6.  It will be nice once this is
released and RPMs exist for this.

Here are the steps that I used to get a working build of i3 and dmenu
on RHEL 6 Beta 2:

- Got to src

   cd /usr/src/

- Install required packages from the DVD

   /media/RHEL_6.0 x86_64 Disc 1/Packages
   rpm -Uvh libX11-devel-1.3-2.el6.x86_64.rpm
libXau-devel-1.0.5-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
libXdmcp-devel-1.0.3-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
libxcb-devel-1.5-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
xorg-x11-proto-devel-7.4-35.el6.noarch.rpm
libXinerama-devel-1.1-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
libXext-devel-1.1-2.el6.x86_64.rpm yajl-1.0.7-3.el6.x86_64.rpm

- Install required packages available from YUM

   yum install yajl-devel xcb-util-devel

- Get sources not available in RPMs

   wget http://dist.schmorp.de/libev/libev-3.9.tar.gz
   wget http://dl.suckless.org/tools/dmenu-4.1.1.tar.gz
   wget http://i3.zekjur.net/downloads/i3-3.e-bf1.tar.bz2

   tar zxvf libev-3.9.tar.gz
   tar zxvf dmenu-4.1.1.tar.gz
   tar jxvf i3-3.e-bf1.tar.bz2

- Make and install from sources

   cd /usr/src/dmenu-4.1.1/
   make clean install
   cd /usr/src/libev-3.9/
   ./configure
   make
   make install
   echo '/usr/local/lib/' > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libev.conf
   ldconfig
   cd /usr/src/i3-3.e-bf1/
   make clean
   make
   make install


Gentoo was so much easier to get this installed and working.

I?m not so familiar with RPM-based distributions, but cassmodiah told me that
his RPMs are usable in Fedora, RHEL and CentOS. Check 
https://admin.fedoraproject.org/community/?package=i3#package_maintenance

BTW: What do you mean with "once this is released"? i3 is released for quite
some time.

> Gentoo was so much easier to get this installed and working.
Well, we?re still not in the official gentoo portage tree. The linux
distributions which have a very easy installation of i3 are Debian and Arch
Linux.

Best regards,
Michael

Subject: [i3] menu with dzen
Message-ID: <4C7E79D0.3060302@ganomi.com>

Hi.

I am trying to create menu, but unable to find a solution.
I would like menu where after clicking with left button of the mouse on 
dzen2 bar the menu is displayed. The following line does not work and I 
am not what would be the correct format. All the example I found are 
without using i3status...

line in i3 config file:

#exec i3status -c ~/.i3/i3status.conf | i3-wsbar -c "dzen2 -x %x -dock 
-e 
'onstart=exec:x-terminal-emulator:skype:x-www-browser;entertitle=uncollapse,grabkeys;enterslave=grabkeys;leaveslave=collapse,ungrabkeys;button1=menuexec;button2=togglestick;button3=exit:13;button4=scrollup;button5=scrolldown;key_Escape=ungrabkeys,exit' 
-p -l 1 -m v < /home/user/.i3/dzenmenu1 "


dzenmenu file:
Internet:firefox


Any suggestions or example of your menu?

I meant RHEL 6 released.  Once it is released, other repos will start
adding packages that RedHat doesn't, like fluxbox (what I was using
recently) and rxvt-unicode.

They are in overlays, which are pretty easy to add.  If I ever tire of
Gentoo, I'd probably try Arch.

Subject: [i3] How to mark workspace as urgent?
Message-ID: <AANLkTim2=yFp8BPw7M6szUCgOgDtO3RUrb6TBe=zc0yJ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, i want to create a simple notify system in my desktop, and
by using i3 i see that exists a routine to mark workspaces
with a red color [1] when a client?s urgency hint is made.

Its any way to execute this routine with i3-msg? I want to
execute a routine that marks a workspace in the status bar...

Hi Hugo,

> Its any way to execute this routine with i3-msg? I want to

No, that?s not implemented. You have two possibilities: Either you create a
window on that workspace (or use an existing one) and set the urgent hint on
it. Alternatively, you could implement a command to mark a workspace as urgent.
It should be pretty easy.

Best regards,
Michael

Hi Michael, i make a command to mark a workspace as urgent in commands.c
it's works fine but only if workspace exist.

It can be called by i3-msg:

    i3-msg urgent1

Thanks for you reply.
Bye.
