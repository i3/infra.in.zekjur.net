Subject: [i3] ideas on layout using mouse
Message-ID: <CAF8zdKsFhmWcbDEmCfdt-pM2R536mYU22Ed8CYOKE_R2b_=OfA@mail.gmail.com>

Apologies if these ideas have been considered before:

I'd love to see the ability to layout windows by dragging them, similar to
the way Eclipse (the IDE) does it:
- You can drag a window into any container.
- Dragging towards the left or right of the container causes it to split
horizontally and place the window to the left or right.
- Dragging towards the top or bottom of the container causes it to split
vertically and place the window above or below.
- Dragging towards the middle of an untabbed container creates a tabbed
layout and places the window in a new tab.
- Dragging to the tab bar of a tabbed container places the window in a new
tab.

I realize i3 isn't meant to be mouse-oriented, but this would make window
re-organization more efficient for me. It takes too many operations to
reorganize window layout since containers must be split *first* before a
window can be moved into it.  Using mouse-dragging, this becomes a one-step
operation.

I?m not convinced that this is a good idea. Specifically, my suspicion
is that once a feature like this is implemented, it won?t suit enough
users and people will want to customize the behavior in detail (leading
to lots of complexity, code paths and option explosion). Also, I suspect
it?ll require quite a bit of new code.

That said, I reserve the right to change my mind after seeing a well
done patch and demonstration of how awesome such a feature is.

Subject: [i3] Clone just one workspace between displays
Message-ID: <CAM+8gfV1daexKjFyj-jHJT2MdyjqFFCjQCYT66psPqjsL6nNeA@mail.gmail.com>

I am going to do a presentation, hopefully with i3. Ideally, I'd be able to
have one workspace on my laptop cloned to the projector, so that I can have
notes hidden but also be able to see what I'm typing on the big screen
without having to crane my neck. I have read that this is not possible with
vanilla i3, as it does not do compositing. (
http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#presentations,
https://faq.i3wm.org/question/2517/assign-an-app-to-multiple-workstations/).
I would like to know: how *can* I do this? Is there a program that can add
this functionality (maybe just clone individual windows)? Is there another
tiling window manager known to be able to do this?

Subject: [i3] Viable testing strategy?
Message-ID: <52F6A391.6010105@hunsicker.de>

Howdy,

I'm currently playing with the i3 testing framework in order to learn 
how to provide a test case for the proposed IPC event extension.

After some fiddling, I've come up with the following test case to ensure 
that opening a window results in two window events, "new" and "focus", 
in that order.

Below is the source code of the test:

======================================================
#!perl

use i3test;
use threads;
use threads::shared;

my $i3 = i3(get_socket_path());
$i3->connect()->recv;

################################
# Window event
################################

# Events

my @events :shared;
my $subscribed :shared;

sub record_events() {
     $i3->subscribe({
         window => sub {
             my ($event) = @_;
             say 'received '.$event->{change};
             push @events, $event->{change};
         }
     })->recv;

     $subscribed = 1;

     say 'subscribed';

     AE::cv->recv;
}

sub count_events() {
     my $count = 0;

     while ($count < 15 && @events < 2) {
         $count++;
         select(undef, undef, undef, 0.1);
     }
}

my $t1 = threads->new( {'void' => 1}, sub { record_events() });
my $t2 = threads->new( {'void' => 1}, sub { count_events() });

while (!$subscribed) {
     select(undef, undef, undef, 0.1);
}

open_window;

$t2->join();

say 'number of events '. at events ;

foreach (@events) {
     say 'event='.$_;
  }

ok(@events eq 2, 'Window event count correct');
ok($events[0] eq 'new', 'Window "new" event received');
ok($events[1] eq 'focus', 'Window "focus" event received');

done_testing;
======================================================


Now, this seems to work most of the time, but sometimes the test fails 
with the following output:


======================================================
Test output:
[:1] t/205-ipc-windows.t: starting
[:1] t/205-ipc-windows.t: finished
output for t/205-ipc-windows.t:
subscribed
received focus
number of events 1
event=focus
not ok 1 - Window event count correct

#   Failed test 'Window event count correct'
#   at ./t/205-ipc-windows.t line 79.
not ok 2 - Window "new" event received

#   Failed test 'Window "new" event received'
#   at ./t/205-ipc-windows.t line 80.
Use of uninitialized value $events[1] in string eq at 
./t/205-ipc-windows.t line 81.
not ok 3 - Window "focus" event received

#   Failed test 'Window "focus" event received'
#   at ./t/205-ipc-windows.t line 81.
1..3
======================================================


Only the focus event is received. But when I check the corresponding log 
file, it clearly says two events have been sent! (See the attached log 
file).

This makes me wonder. Is this approach ill fated and simply not robust 
enough? Or does it seem suspicious that only one event is received while 
two events were sent? The subscription seems to be established before 
any event is sent, but the first event is still lost!?

Thanks for any feedback you can provide.

Cheers,
   Marco

Message-ID: <20140212150210.GA20731@nyx>

When I have a (vertical) split and use resize, then hit an arrow key,
the split border oftentimes is moved in the *opposite* direction, making
the whole process highly non-deterministic from a user?s perspective.

When I move the left window right and attempt it again, the direction
the window border moves is changed.

The same happens with horizontal splits.

After some messing around I assume that the concept is not to move the
border, but to make the window smaller or to embiggen (sic!) it.
But then, why is making it horizontally bigger/smaller mapped to down/up
and not up/down? And what?s the reasoning behind the assignment of
left/right?


Another thing that gets me everytime is to be in resize mode and
forgetting about it. A timeout for that would be nice.


Yet another thing that bugs me is that I can only use the hardware
escape, and e.g. neo2?s ESC on Layer 4 doesn?t work. Is this because the
key?s hardcoded?


I didn?t want to open bugs on trac because I don?t know which have been
filed yet (the search function is not very helpful), which ones are
design decisions and the Yet-Another-One-Shot-Account problem.

I found the default bindings misleading as well. then I stumbled on
that configuration which may makemore sense:
 mode "resize" {

       # Pressing right will grow the window?s width.
        # Pressing up will shrink the window?s height.
        # Pressing down will grow the window?s height.
        bindsym j resize grow left 10 px or 10 ppt
        bindsym Shift+j resize shrink left 10 px or 10 ppt

        bindsym k resize grow up  10 px or 10 ppt
        bindsym Shift+k resize shrink up 10 px or 10 ppt

        bindsym l resize grow down 10 px or 10 ppt
        bindsym Shift+l resize shrink down 10 px or 10 ppt

        bindsym m resize grow right 10 px or 10 ppt
        bindsym Shift+m resize shrink right 10 px or 10 ppt
}
Hope that helps

i3 ? 4.4 has a mode indicator in i3bar which is fairly well visible.
Timeouts have been discussed here:

With regards to ?hard-coding?: depends on your configuration file. The
default config uses ?bindsym Escape?, which should work with every
escape key. That said, I can reproduce the bug, i.e. the layer 4 escape
does not work for me either.

Note that you don?t need an account to report bugs at i3, for precisely
that reason.

Personally I bind mod+control+j/k/l/; to resize. Then I don't need to
switch modes at all to resize. IMO mode switching should be reserved
for ultra-rare actions (and preferably a one-shot thing that returns
to the default mode as part of it's action) and resizing windows is
something I do quite frequently.


I do find I often mix up the directions to resize and have to correct myself:

- If I'm resizing a window that happens to be at the top-left,
everything is fine because the directions correspond to the direction
that the only free corner (i.e. the bottom-right corner) will move.

- If I'm resizing a window that happens to be at the bottom-right, I
get everything backwards because the directions still correspond to
the bottom-right corner, but that isn't the corner that is moving (the
top-left corner will move).

- If I'm resizing a window somewhere in the middle of the screen I
tend to get mixed up some/most of the time, because although I'm
pressing ONE direction, the window resizes in TWO directions (i.e. I
pressed resize right, but the window expanded both left and right).

I'm not really sure what a good solution to that is :-/

I'm thinking about swapping the vertical resize keys so both expand
keys (l/;) are on the right and both shrink keys are on the left
(h/j), but I'll probably end up with just as much brainfuck, only in
different circumstances...

Cheers,
-Ian

Subject: [i3] i3status only displays the temperature from one sensor
Message-ID: <5308A213.3060201@hunsicker.de>

Howdy,

I've ran into a small problem with i3status. I want to show temperatures 
for all CPU cores, but i3status always shows the same temperature for 
all cores!


My relevant config looks like this:

order += "cpu_temperature 1"
order += "cpu_temperature 2"
order += "cpu_temperature 3"
order += "cpu_temperature 4"

cpu_temperature 1 {
     format = "%degrees?"
     path = "/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/temp2_input"
     max_threshold = 70
}
cpu_temperature 2 {
     format = "%degrees?"
     path = "/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/temp3_input"
     max_threshold = 70
}
cpu_temperature 3 {
     format = "%degrees?"
     path = "/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/temp4_input"
     max_threshold = 70
}
cpu_temperature 4 {
     format = "%degrees?"
     path = "/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/temp5_input"
     max_threshold = 70
}

The output is:

[
{"name":"cpu_temperature","instance":"/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/temp1_input","full_text":"28?"},
{"name":"cpu_temperature","instance":"/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/temp1_input","full_text":"28?"},
{"name":"cpu_temperature","instance":"/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/temp1_input","full_text":"28?"},
{"name":"cpu_temperature","instance":"/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/temp1_input","full_text":"28?"}
]

Always the same path is used!


Looking at src/print_cpu_temperature.c, the following code seems to be 
the culprit:

     if (thermal_zone == NULL) {
         if (path == NULL)
             asprintf(&thermal_zone, THERMAL_ZONE, zone);
         else
             asprintf(&thermal_zone, path, zone);
     }
     path = thermal_zone;



I've changed my copy to:

     if (path == NULL) {
         if (thermal_zone == NULL) {
             if (path == NULL)
                 asprintf(&thermal_zone, THERMAL_ZONE, zone);
             else
                 asprintf(&thermal_zone, path, zone);
         }
         path = thermal_zone;
     }

as I provide the full paths to the sensor outputs in my config file.

But before I submit a patch, I wanted to ask whether this still catches 
the intention of this method?

The man page only rudimentary describes this feature and it's not clear 
to me whether the parameter substitution should always take place.

Can anybody please clarify? Thanks!

Cheers,
   Marco

I think your code will actually not work properly either, because
thermal_zone is a static variable. I think you?ll need to kill that
variable entirely to make multiple instances of the cpu_temperature
module work.

The temperatures are correctly displayed for me. With my configuration, 
'path' should never be NULL and therefore 'thermal_zone' never actually 
used.

But yes, I would question the use of the static variable entirely. It's 
not clear to me what the intention here is. Thanks.

I think inlining the variable is the right thing to do:

         char *thermal_zone;

         if (path == NULL)
                 asprintf(&thermal_zone, THERMAL_ZONE, zone);
         else
                 asprintf(&thermal_zone, path, zone);

         path = thermal_zone;

	[...]

	free(thermal_zone);


This way multiple instances work - with our without parameter substitution.

Cheers,
   Marco

Message-ID: <530F9EE6.4030007@hunsicker.de>

Howdy,

I don't fancy the vertical separators i3status uses to separate the 
different modules.

I know that it's possible to alter the generated JSON (when one uses the 
i3bar format) to get rid of the separators. But I think it would be 
nice, if i3status could support it out-of-the-box for all formats.

I would propose the addition of a new "separator(true|false)" directive 
to the general section. When set to 'false', separators would be simply 
hidden with i3bar. For the other formats, a blank space would be generated.

It this something that sounds acceptable? Thanks.

Cheers,
   Marco

I would prefer an implicit-separator, or explicit-separator option.
That way, if separators were explicit, you would have to insert them
yourself with `order += separator', giving full flexibility in the matter.

IMHO this would be too much of a hassle for little gain as it would 
require all users to adjust their configuration.

I've forwarded a patch for code review that allows a bit more freedom as 
my initial proposal.

It allows one to configure the separator string that should be used. An 
empty string disables the insertion of a default separator altogether.

This way it's possible to allow customization for all output formats, 
but only with i3bar one is required to resort to the module format 
string for the actual definition, while with the other formats you can 
conveniently define it just once and avoid the otherwise probably 
necessary duplication in the module definitions.

This should support your use case as well. Disable the default 
separator. Then add any necessary separation as part of a module's 
format string.

Cheers,
   Marco

That's not necessary -- no overriding could just be inferred to mean
"the old style".

Subject: [i3] [i3status] Support min_width and align options in module
	definition
Message-ID: <5310D837.10508@hunsicker.de>

Howdy,

when using the i3bar output format, I would find it convenient if I 
could set "min_width" and "align" right in a module definition.

disk "/" {
     format = "%avail"
     min_width = 80
     align = "left"
}

Would this be something worthwhile to add? Thanks.

Cheers,
   Marco

I would also find this useful; without this, some items change in size and
are distracting when they shift the entire bar.
