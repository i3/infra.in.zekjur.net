<PRE>Hi guys,

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (that is, without saving, editing and restoring a layout)
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> Save a layout, edit it to contain a single placeholder window, restore it?
</I>
&gt;<i> This is the only thing I can think of.
</I>
I expected that answer, that's why I made the previous clarification.
Still I expected it, because that was just a trifling fancy of mine
and the answer was so blatantly obvious that it needed to be stated
plain and clear, at least once. That said, to start a philosophical
discussion about the paradigms of different tilers is far for my will.
I was just pointing out that a number of possibilities that until now
were in the exclusive domain of more static manual tilers (including
emacs and vim) become possible in i3 because of its new ability to
manipulate placeholders as if they were just normal clients. I thought
that, perhaps, there was an undocumented trick to create placeholders
on the fly, kinda &quot;exec nothing&quot;, which would be akin to splitting in,
say, ratpoison. It's clear that I can get the same &quot;saving, editing
and restoring a layout&quot; but I was emphasizing the dynamic side of the
idea. For example, I could want to create two placeholders in order to
horizontally center my pdf reader in a wide screen. It's pretty easy
to do that in i3 by opening two dummy terminals at each side of the
reader, without resorting to any predefined layout. Those dummy
terminals are just acting as placeholders. You see how whimsical I am.

Cheers
