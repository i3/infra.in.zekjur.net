</I>&gt;<i> on the fly, kinda &quot;exec nothing&quot;, which would be akin to splitting in,
</I>&gt;<i> say, ratpoison. It's clear that I can get the same &quot;saving, editing
</I>&gt;<i> and restoring a layout&quot; but I was emphasizing the dynamic side of the
</I>&gt;<i> idea. For example, I could want to create two placeholders in order to
</I>&gt;<i> horizontally center my pdf reader in a wide screen. It's pretty easy
</I>&gt;<i> to do that in i3 by opening two dummy terminals at each side of the
</I>&gt;<i> reader, without resorting to any predefined layout. Those dummy
</I>&gt;<i> terminals are just acting as placeholders. You see how whimsical I am.

I think the „open” command is what you're looking for.
I wonder why is it not documented…
