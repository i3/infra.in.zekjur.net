Hi Anders,

Quoting Anders Bo Rasmussen (2012-07-31 21:32:50)
> Hi Michael. Thanks. That made it work.
I checked that again, and I think you should not use this hack. Instead,
use this:

#!/usr/bin/env perl
# vim:ts=4:sw=4:expandtab

use strict;
use warnings;
use Data::Dumper;
use AnyEvent;
use AnyEvent::I3;
use v5.10;

my $i3 = i3();

$i3->connect->recv or die "Error connecting to i3";

$i3->subscribe({
    workspace => sub {
        $i3->get_tree->cb(sub {
            my ($tree) = @_;
            say "tree: " . Dumper($tree);
        });
    }
})->recv->{success} or die "Error subscribing to events";

AE::cv->recv

(Note the asynchronous callback when calling get_tree)

Well, AnyEvent code ideally shouldn?t be tied to any specific
implementation (EV in this case), so it?s not a good idea to advertise
code like that.

As a follow-up: The "strange things" were:

1) ->subscribe not automatically establishing a connection to i3. After
   re-reading the docs I noticed that there is the special _error
   callback which lets you deal with reconnecting. Therefore, it kinda
   makes sense to not interfere with connecting to i3 in this method.
   Instead, we might introduce a "sugar" method (like the others) for
   events some day.

2) I couldn?t use $i3->get_tree->recv(), but had to use
   i3->get_tree->recv() (new connection instead of the existing one)
   when using the EV::loop hack. When not using it, using the existing
   connection is just fine.

Best regards,
Michael

I'll be there and happy to help. Still need to figure out where I stay
at night, but during the day I'm sure I can spend a bit of my time to help and explain.

"setxkbmap fa" (or whatever the keyboard layout name is)
(You can put that in your xinitrc or use "exec" in your i3 config.)

You will have to adapt the bindsym statements in your i3 config though.
It may be easier to use bindcode instead of bindsym (at least if you
find yourself switching between keyboard layouts)
You can use the "xev" tool to find out the key names / key codes.

Greetings

Does i3 support having two or more overlapping floaters and toggling
between them with e.g. M-tab or some similar function?

The default config doesn't have an example function that I can (re-)use
with bindkey, or at least I didn't see one.

Actually now that I tested this, focus works fine, and when I have two
overlapping windows in floating mode, the focus moves to the window
'behind' the visible one.
But the window stacking order doesn't change, so the focused window is now
'raised'.

Is there any option that enables auto-raise for the focused window when I
use something like this in my .i3/config file?

bindsym $mod+Tab    focus right

Nope. I would accept patches for a "raise" command, though.

Yes, that was a typo indeed.

Cool. I'll try to come up with a patch.  I originally thought it may be
nice to have a 'focus_raise' command that can be bound like 'focus',
e.g. with the following in ~/.i3/config:

  bindsym $mod+Tab    focus_raise right

But since this doesn't make sense for clients that are fully tiled
inside a container, I think I'll try first to add a tunable option,
e.g.:

  raise_on_focus enable

I'll get back when I have something more concrete :-)

Subject: [i3] I would need a strong focus indicator...
Message-ID: <20120813112830.3625f8f8@pc-cm-gru-virtlinux1>

Hello,

Since using i3 I definetely love it. Great work :)
I have only one problem with programs that don't clearly show if they
have focus. I already asked about making the border around the windows
thicker, but this approach seems not to be good.

Have a look at the attached picture to see my problem: at first
glance, without thinking: which window has the focus?

Even though I used a very noticeable colour to mark the focus, I type
in the wrong window very often. rxvt does this right: you can dim
the colours of the inactive windows and spot the active one
immediately. But I think, this is not a task for the
applications. Maybe it's not task of the window manager, neither. But
"traditional" window managers (and even i3 in tabbed mode) clearly
show which window has the focus...

Do you have any idea how to clearly show the focus in my example? Is
it possible to somehow "shadow" windows that don't have the focus?

Thanks,

i've had similar issues at times and always wondered whether one potential
way to solve this might be to allow the kind of "gutters" between windows
such as are found in some other tiling wms. this way the highlighting could
be set to varying pixels by users, perhaps even on a per-application basis.

strictly speaking, the gutters wouldn't be necessary for a 'more than 1px'
border, but aesthetically i think they make more sense both together than
either one of them on their own.

It looks like a different color would be more visible in this case,
e.g. a red border for the active client?  I agree that this is a slightly
hacky way of fixing this. Indeed bright red or similar colors are less
necessary with dark themes, but with light color themes it's
often better to have a brighter border color.

Then titles of windows are visible, there are no problem to recognize 
which window is active. Consider enabling titles and see the difference.

Yes, this would help getting rid of the focus problem. But
unfortunately, I would like to have both: 1pixel mode and a good focus
indication. The "I don't waste any space" function of i3 is one of my
favourites.

I think this may be possible only by somehow changing the colours of
the other windows (like rxvt can do it) or by some marching ants. I
have to admit that I have no idea if/how this can be done in i3 or if
it is even in the scope of i3.

Perhaps it is possible to write a program that shades other programs
colours. Sounds a bit like compositing...


So for now I'll have to live with it, but thanks for all your answers!

For the last couple releases, I've added some patches to i3 to have it
compile on OS X.  A simple `make' should work just fine.  Are you

You need to install all the libraries i3 depends upon, see the file
DEPENDS in the source code's top level directory.

No, it?s not. This is only possible when the window manager is a
compositing window manager, which i3 is not.

Actually, not too long ago I looked into this, turned out EWMH defines
_NET_WM_STATE_FOCUSED [1] and toolkits can use this to implement such
functionality. The sad thing is only GTK3 actually does this [2], so
even though it's not much effort to get support for that in i3, I doubt
it's worth it at this point.

[1] http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html#id2578152
[2] It does this using an extra CSS property (:window-unfocused), so it's
     theme dependent

How about adding ability to set dotted or dashed borders?
Once their colours are set to some contrasting pair (black and white?),
they will be visible around virtually any window
while still maintaining 1-pixel width.

Hello,

Yes, that would be "standing ants" instead of marching ants ;)
I like this idea, it would certainly be more visible than the solid
line that we have now...

I might try to study the current implementation and send a patch - but
don't rely on me ;)

Subject: [i3] Borders lost on urxvt and gimp floating windows "stuck" when
 restarting i3
Message-ID: <CAMALoy-zVBs_c4evH_7ewrFp3+R==ELKSuDShjAwv_qPgpKBqA@mail.gmail.com>

Before I enable i3 debugging and submitting a bug for this I thought
I'd ask the mailing list.

Whenever I restart i3 (after a config change for example) I lose the
window borders around urxvt and if I have Gimp open the floating
windows lose all borders and become "stuck" to the top left corner of
the desktop, follow me to each desktop, cover other windows and I can
only kill them by killing the main Gimp window.

Before restart:
http://ompldr.org/vZjYxYQ/2012-08-20_1345455420_1280x800_scrot.png

After restart:
http://ompldr.org/vZjYxYg/2012-08-20_1345455428_1280x800_scrot.png

In the last screenshot you may notice the warning "IPC: received EOF
instead of reply", not sure if that provides any clues.

I used the vanilla i3 configuration to test and I'm using i3 version
4.2-1 on Debian Unstable 64 bit.

Thanks for any advise.

Regards,

James

Subject: [i3] scratchpad window doesn't open when already opened
Message-ID: <20120821122910.GB3235@finrod>

hi.
I've noticed with the scratchpad window that if I open it on a workspace and
then move to a different workspace I cannot bring it up again. I need to
return the the original workspace and put it into background to open it on the
new workspace again. This kind of negates the purpose of the scratchpad.
Is this a feature, bug or just my missunderstanding?

I'm using debian packages from testing version 4.2-1

thanks for help

Subject: [i3] [PATCH] Fix 'back and forth' in 'workspace number <number>'
Message-ID: <1345583976-6481-1-git-send-email-sebasti@nullrich.de>

From: Sebastian Ullrich <sebasti at nullrich.de>

As mentioned in #i3, while this patch works for me, I'm not sure
how the (untouched) maybe_back_and_forth invocation directly
above could ever return true (ie, a non-existing ws would have
to be focused?).

The 'scratchpad show' command will only look at the scratchpad
pseudo-workspace for windows to show. This explains what you are seeing.
I don?t think it?s a bug, but the functionality could be enhanced to
cover your use case. In case you?re interested, please file a feature
request at http://bugs.i3wm.org/

If you want to avoid this effect, you can use the scratchpad show
command with criteria, like this:

    bindsym Mod4+c [instance="cmus"] scratchpad show

This will work on any workspace, because the window is found by checking
its instance, *then* calling scratchpad show on it.

Best regards,
Michael

Thanks for your patch. Here are a few observations:

1) s/a urgent/an urgent/ ;-)

2) nodes_head only contains tiling children. Since floating children can
   only be attached to a workspace and your changes don?t have any
   effect in this situation, this is actually correct. Nevertheless, it
   makes sense to think about whether to use nodes_head, floating_head
   or focus_head (which contains both, but in a different order)
   whenever you are using recursion. Therefore, please add a comment
   explaining the situation.

3) In src/x.c, you check if con_is_leaf and then call
   con_has_urgent_child. Since the latter also checks that, it seems
   superfluous.

4) Thinking about how you do it (setting urgent to true), I think it?s
   better to do this once (instead of on every draw_decoration call)
   when the urgency state changes, see src/handlers.c:handle_hints:819.

It?d be worthwhile to have a testcase for this, too (or expand
t/113-urgent.t). Please have a look at
http://i3wm.org/docs/testsuite.html

Thanks for working on this.

Best regards,
Michael

The corruption you see there should be fixed after switching workspaces,
right?

This means that the windows are not managed by i3 anymore. This sounds
like a bug, only a full debug level logfile (and a ticket) will be
helpful to debug this.

Also, please upgrade to latest git 'next' before you file a ticket. See
http://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html

Could you do this with any window? (not specifically an instance)

OMG /o\ ? please don?t do that. This is very prone to race-conditions.
We can use waitpid() to wait for the child instead (or maybe a libev
child handler to make it async).

Magic numbers are bad, mhkay? Use strlen("/tmp/") instead, the compiler
will optimize it away at compile-time.

Also, this code won?t work. core_pattern is not a static filename, it?s
a pattern. I have it set to /tmp/%e.core.%p for example. Figuring out
the location of the core dump is actually a pretty hard problem and I
don?t see an obvious solution for it.

I think it?d be better to have gdb attached to the current process.

Thanks for working on this,
Best regards,
Michael

Sorry, Michael,

If I understood correctly, the report is that in case of a general command
to show the scratchpad does not work, if it is already visible in another
workspace. Then, if you imply the instance/class of a particular window,
then it works...

I was wondering if there is a way to make this valid for any scratchpad
instead... I tried with a catch all regex, and it just brought all windows
(not only the scratchpad ones) to the current workspace.

 bindsym Mod+minus [instance="^.*$"] scratchpad show

Maybe this should behave only on the scratchpad windows? In any case, if I
have multiple windows there, they would all come out, which is not what we
want either...

I think I lost my question here... anyway, the point is that I find myself
often looking for my scratchpad window because I dont know where it is
(need to go through all workspaces until I find it), and I thought this
could be a good place to brainstorm a way to improve that, if possible.

Thanks,

I already suggested to enhance the 'workspace show' command in a way
that makes this possible:

I have attached the log file and images I linked to earlier on in the
ticket.  Must be some issue in Chromium on Debian as the upload from
Chrome on Windows worked fine.

Thanks again.

Subject: [i3] splitting windows - idea
Message-ID: <503775DB.6020202@gmx.net>

Hello,

first of all: great wm! Thank you very much for your work.

I discovered is that you can not specify on which side you want to split
the window. It is always the right (or lower) side.

My idea:
Leave it that way as default, but if the user also presses another key
(down, up, k, l, ...) that indicates a direction i3 use this side.

Keys pressed = result:
$mod+v = new Window under the existing one
$mod+v+down = the same result
$mod+v+up = now the window appears above the old one
Something equal for splitting horizontally.


Kind Regards,

Jean

Yeah, I achieve that with 2 commands:
$mod+v then $mod+Shift+up

I believe the $mod+v+up would not work because it would trigger the $mod+v
before you could reach the up key... unless both h/v requires the extra
argument in every case... in this way, then better another key that just
sets the next window to any direction: $mod+n+? (n for next, and ? could be
up, down, left, right)....

But to be honest, $mod+h/v is still unbeatable (faster/simpler)!

This introduces a lot of new keybindings, configuration changes,
documentation changes, friction on upgrade for users and I don?t see a
clear benefit.

The splitting works by creating a new split container and placing the
current window in it. We always append new windows to the end of the
node list. This is the cause for your observation that new windows
appear "below" existing windows. Since from left to right and top to
bottom is very natural, I don?t see an advantage in introducing an
additional feature which puts new windows at the top of the node list.

Best regards,
Michael

Subject: [i3] Disable certain i3-nagbar events?
Message-ID: <CAMALoy9e3qFux3BufHE=wU67=xQT+FNAkSbjAfr12ptxLo_W1g@mail.gmail.com>

This could also be titled "i3-nagbar returns an error with valid
keybinding that cannot execute due to window at edge of screen", but
that's a big subject line.

I am using version 4.2-251-gc8cfc77 on Debian Unstable.  The problem
did not exist in 4.2-1.

I use the key bindings at the end of this email.  If for example, I
have 2 terminal windows open side by side and try by accident to
execute Control+Mod4+Left (grow left side of window west) on the left
had terminal window I receive the i3-nagbar error "The configured
command for this shortcut could not be run successfully".  This is
valid error since I cannot increase the left side of terminal window
left since it's already at the edge of the screen.

So is there a way to disable certain i3-nagbar events that whilst
valid, I can safely ignore and know that I have made a typo with my
window resizing command?

# grow left side west
bindsym Control+Mod4+Left resize grow left 5 px or 5 ppt
# shrink left side east
bindsym Control+Mod4+Right resize shrink left 5 px or 5 ppt
# shrink right side west
bindsym Mod1+Mod4+Left resize shrink right 5 px or 5 ppt
# grow right side east
bindsym Mod1+Mod4+Right resize grow right 5 px or 5 ppt
# grow bottom side south
bindsym Control+Mod4+Down resize grow down 5 px or 5 ppt
# shrink bottom side north
bindsym Control+Mod4+Up resize shrink down 5 px or 5 ppt
# shrink top side south
bindsym Mod1+Mod4+Down resize shrink up 5 px or 5 ppt
# grow top side north
bindsym Mod1+Mod4+Up resize grow up 5 px or 5 ppt
