I pushed http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3lock/commit/?id=2f17b73e2,
hopefully that fixes the problem. Could you build from source and
confirm please?

Hi,

Sorry for the delay, I was mostly offline this weekend.

I don't think there's a fallback, if the fonts weren't visible then you'd see those Unicode squares. At least that's what happens if I recall correctly when your font doesn't support diacritics or arab characters, for instance.

I don't know from where Pango extracts the size information, but if it's part of the font metadata, it might be a bug in the font itself. Or maybe it's just cap height + descent, and some glyphs may exceed those boundaries. pango_layout_get_font_size doesn't specify anything about what "size" is? :-/

Regards,

There is something like a fallback font (I know that when rendering
mathematical symbols that are not covered by my monospace font, it falls
back to DejaVu Sans -- resulting in those symbols to be way too big).

Some googling shows f.ex.

Subject: [i3] [OT] shellex - shell based launcher
Message-ID: <1378218304-sup-2732@merovius.de>

Hi all,

though not really i3-specific, there were a few people in the
past who asked in the IRC-channel for a command launcher with history
support and tab-completion. Some people use bashrun for that, some
people where referred to shellex, an old try at a zsh based launcher of
mine, which was in no state to use.

I recently restarted work on shellex [1] and would like to announce it here
in case anyone is still looking for such a thing. It is still WIP and
not yet as comfortable to use as dmenu, but I now consider it stable
enough to be used and to be usefull (for example history and tab
completion worked on every system I tried).

Kind Regards,

Merovius

Hi,
I was wondering if there's a way to have some sort of a sidebar,
displayed on every worspace with a constant width, even if there are no
other windows on the workspace. Usefull as I think for a chat/rss
programs.
So far I haven't found any configuration to do this.
Thanks,

Not that I am aware of.

If there are no windows on a workspace, it is not displayed on i3bar...
this is by design.

You could use the i3status (or conky) for displaying other stuff you want,
which is available in the bottom (or top) of the screen no matter where you
are.

This is awesome idea!

Right now, any more complicated commands I need to run I wrap on a script
and leave on my $PATH for dmenu to find it...
More recently I am using Synapse, which is even worse in this case (I need
to create an app desktop file, similar to what i3-dmenu does).

This would definitely improve things!

The only thing i3lock does is turning off the screen when there is no
input in the buffer. Turning the screen on (and off after a timeout) is
the X11 server?s doing, so you need to check your DPMS settings.

The next time, please write to either the mailing list i3-discuss
(cc'ed) or open a bugreport in order to get a more timely response and
publicly archive the question/response.

Hi!.

I'm tried to change client color for clients titled 'MUTT' with

for_window [title="MUTT"] client.unfocused #000000 #000000 #ff0000
for_window [title="MUTT"] client.focused_inactive #000000 #000000 #ff0000

This pass ok the configuration check but don't seems to work.

Is it possible to alter colors on one client only during runtime?

Thanks

No. The colors are a configuration directive, and for_window only
accepts commands. There are no plans of changing this.

Subject: [i3] i3-theme script and a small collection of themes
Message-ID: <20130918022152.GA5861@cisa85.de>

Dear i3 community,

i have developed a script named i3-theme. Its purpose is
to easily set and switch between several sets of
configuration options ("themes") for the i3 window
manager. These sets of configuration options are supposed
to contain options regarding the looks of the window
manager, that is window colors, borderstyle, i3bar colors,
fonts, etc.
There's a bunch of theme files which are distributed
together with the i3-theme script to give the user a
variety of configurations to choose from.

The tarball containing the script, the themes and a README
can be found at:

http://www.okraits.de/upload/i3-theme-0.3.tar.gz

Please feel free to send me feedback and contributions
regarding bugreports, feature requests, improvements,
themes, etc. via mail at okraits at arcor.de. You can also
contact me on irc.twice-irc.de in #i3.

I'm looking forward to your feedback.

Greetings,

Oliver

Hi all,

FYI, there's a new version of the script with more themes available at

Please check the README for the changelog.

I will add an i3-theme section to my website http://okraits.de where the newest version will be available.

Hi Veljko,

thank you for providing screenshots. I have done screenshots too, but i have to add an i3-theme section to my website first and will then add the screenshots there. Maybe this will happen in some hours.

Greetings,

Oliver

I wondered if there is a command to remove a container and move all
children to the parent of the now removed container?

Subject: [i3] Fullscreen over two monitors
Message-ID: <20130924120116.GA7343@angelina.cable.vektor.net>

Hi,

Is it possible to make window fullscreen over two or all monitors? It
can be handy when one have some really long line in editor. I know I can
make that window floating and then stretch it over both visibe
workspaces, but is there some native, tiling wm method?

Regards,
Veljko

That seams to be what I need, but it doesn't work quite right. It moves
window on left workspace and makes it fullscreen only on that workspace.
Right workspace is empty, without i3-bar or any other window.

There's no built-in way, but you can always patch i3lock to do it, its
code is really simple.

Also, I'm maintaining a fork of i3lock which features a wrong attempt

As i3lock just uses PAM to authenticate users, you can use pam_tally2
in combination with faillog (see [1]). Alternatively the unix_chkpwd
(i.e. the regular password checking module) logs failures to syslog,
which you could count.

Hi all,

FYI, there's an i3-theme page on my website now.

It contains a link to the latest tarball and
screenshots of all included themes.

You can find it here:

http://www.okraits.de/index.php?section=projects&page=i3-theme

There are some things on the TODO list, so i'll work on that so
that you can expect a new version in the near future.

Greetings,

Oliver

Is version with that patch available in Debian? Is it in 4.6-1?

4.6 does not contain that commit. See
http://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html for the Debian repository with
builds from the latest source.

Subject: [i3] keeping one window protected?
Message-ID: <m2bo3anwek.fsf@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

Hello,

I'm just experimenting with i3wm, as my first tiling manager.  Is the
following possible?

Within workspace 1, I'd like to have my Emacs window on the left half of
the window, and keep it 'pinned there' to half the screen.  On the right
hand half, I'd like the remaining space to be used by whatever
application (a terminal, Firefox, evince) needs it -- and those other
windows exist in e.g. tabbed mode.

What I don't want to happen is for Emacs to shrink as other applications
get added to workspace one.  Does that make sense?

Thanks for a great piece of software.

You can try the following : start emacs, hit split-horizontal if it's not your default, start whatever application you want and focus it, hit split-vertical or split-horizontal, select your preferred mode and finally start some other appications.

I don't know a way of keeping this setup if you close all the application but emacs : since the container for the right half of your workspace wil be destroyed, I don't think it's possible.

You are correct. I?d recommend a stacked or tabbed container on the
right, which you just never empty entirely.
