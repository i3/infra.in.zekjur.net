<PRE>I am also very annoyed by this behavior of vim (and other things) but
I have good hope in the neovim project which intends to solve most of
vim's shortages (www.neovim.org).

As for firefox, you can configure it so that it doesn't tabs.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different terms; I wish vim had this).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately, most people use OSes with a baked-in floating window

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Mac OS X have the market share, you can look forward to Mozilla
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> targeting its UI to users of those OSes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, about vim, I have the same feeling. I'm quite happy to read someone
</I>&gt;<i> saying that vim does too many things.
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I really would like a text editor... no, a code editor with the same
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy (ESPECIALLY for configuration btw!) as i3, but there are some
</I>&gt;<i> issues I guess.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, accessing a file from multiple instances of the editor, which
</I>&gt;<i> is quite common in an IDE (at least, open that file in multiple tabs) will
</I>&gt;<i> probably pulls problems when we spoke about syncing the changes.
</I>&gt;<i> The only solution I can think to solve it is the mpd way: a daemon to handle
</I>&gt;<i> a particular file, and clients just connect to that daemon, so the sync
</I>&gt;<i> problem can be managed.
</I>&gt;<i> But you have to think about one fact, when you speak about vim
</I>&gt;<i> reimplementing a wm (which is true, sadly): it was written in 1991, as a
</I>&gt;<i> console application. I am not sure how gnu screen or other text window
</I>&gt;<i> managers were at that time?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is another problem which make me thinking that an i3 environment is
</I>&gt;<i> not completely usable as an IDE: a multiple window application can't ask the
</I>&gt;<i> wm to place windows in a specific scheme, in the space the wm would have
</I>&gt;<i> allocated to it.
</I>&gt;<i> However, in the next version of i3, there will be layouts, so this might be
</I>&gt;<i> worked around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, I have to admit that several years ago, I was not able to admit
</I>&gt;<i> that it was possible to program without a real IDE (and someone mentioned me
</I>&gt;<i> cube as a counter-example, but I never checked if it was really written
</I>&gt;<i> without an IDE, which would anyway not be provable), now I have even removed
</I>&gt;<i> any file manager from my system.
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks to i3 developers, which have reduced a lot the pain of using
</I>&gt;<i> computers for me. Sadly, now when people take a look at my screens, they see
</I>&gt;<i> me like if I am some kind of E.T. ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm even thinking that it would be very nice to build a DE based on a tiling
</I>&gt;<i> wm, plus softwares which are twm friendly... but I do not think I master the
</I>&gt;<i> thing enough for now, I still have a lot to learn, and trying to create a
</I>&gt;<i> meta-package for that is... well, it made me think a lot about what,
</I>&gt;<i> exactly, would be a minimal DE, since it would be damn stupid to reproduce
</I>&gt;<i> the errors other DEs have, imho, done (I will never understand why DEs'
</I>&gt;<i> meta-packages have hard-dependencies on softwares, instead of simply
</I>&gt;<i> recommending them).
