Well, about vim, I have the same feeling. I'm quite happy to read 
someone saying that vim does too many things.
Now, I really would like a text editor... no, a code editor with the 
same philosophy (ESPECIALLY for configuration btw!) as i3, but there are 
some issues I guess.
For example, accessing a file from multiple instances of the editor, 
which is quite common in an IDE (at least, open that file in multiple 
tabs) will probably pulls problems when we spoke about syncing the 
changes.
The only solution I can think to solve it is the mpd way: a daemon to 
handle a particular file, and clients just connect to that daemon, so 
the sync problem can be managed.
But you have to think about one fact, when you speak about vim 
reimplementing a wm (which is true, sadly): it was written in 1991, as a 
console application. I am not sure how gnu screen or other text window 
managers were at that time?

There is another problem which make me thinking that an i3 environment 
is not completely usable as an IDE: a multiple window application can't 
ask the wm to place windows in a specific scheme, in the space the wm 
would have allocated to it.
However, in the next version of i3, there will be layouts, so this 
might be worked around.

By the way, I have to admit that several years ago, I was not able to 
admit that it was possible to program without a real IDE (and someone 
mentioned me cube as a counter-example, but I never checked if it was 
really written without an IDE, which would anyway not be provable), now 
I have even removed any file manager from my system.
Many thanks to i3 developers, which have reduced a lot the pain of 
using computers for me. Sadly, now when people take a look at my 
screens, they see me like if I am some kind of E.T. ...

I'm even thinking that it would be very nice to build a DE based on a 
tiling wm, plus softwares which are twm friendly... but I do not think I 
master the thing enough for now, I still have a lot to learn, and trying 
to create a meta-package for that is... well, it made me think a lot 
about what, exactly, would be a minimal DE, since it would be damn 
stupid to reproduce the errors other DEs have, imho, done (I will never 
understand why DEs' meta-packages have hard-dependencies on softwares, 
instead of simply recommending them).
