<PRE>Hi Peter,

Excerpts from Peter Johnson's message of So Feb 14 19:15:08 +0100 2010:
&gt;<i> I understand your point of view, to an extent.  But what would you say to
</I>&gt;<i> people who find the existing options too broad?  &quot;Sorry, these are the options
</I>&gt;<i> I as the author find interesting, deal with it&quot; ?  Personally, I've turned off
</I>&gt;<i> ipv6 and dhcp and disk because I find them useless.
</I>If in doubt, yes ;-). However, I think the options are more or less useful to
everybody (with restrictions):

- IPv6: Many people I know use IPv6 every day and in about one or two years
  this will be the normal case&#8230;
- Disk space: Who has unlimited disk space? Who has no disk? ;-)
- Wireless/Battery: Only useful for notebook users, but there are many notebook
  users&#8230;
- System load: Generally useful if you have a lagging systems.
- Date: Speaks for itself
- CPU temperature: While I am not interested in it, some people with rather
  broken laptops seem to care about their CPU not getting too hot.

However, I cannot see a good reason to care about your current CPU speed which
is not only curiosity ;-).

Best regards,
Michael
