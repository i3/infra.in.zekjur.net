<PRE>Hi there!

First, thanks for the work you guys have been doing on i3. I have 
just discovered it in the last few days (using it right now) and 
have installed it in my Slackware-13 64bit system. I plan to toss 
KDE and XFCE in favor of i3. I'm tired of the bloat, and tired of 
my WM getting borked when I work on other things in the system; 
like I upgraded GTK the other day, and XFCE went berzerk :/

Anyhow, here's a random selection of things on my mind currently; 
I'll get more detailed/specific as I pin down various things to a 
useful level of clarity and detail. For the record, I've perused 
the online docs pretty thoroughly, and here is my official apology 
in case I write something here that is mentioned elsewhere :-)

0) I didn't BUILD the docs from source -- should I? Is there 
anything in there that isn't online or in the man page?

1) Should I submit bugs (or whatever) to the TRAC site as an 
anonymous user? Seems silly. Can people subscribe/join the TRAC 
site?

2) I haven't noticed a way of doing wallpaper (background images) 
for i3. Currently, having searched around a fair bit, I'm using 
`feh` but it doesn't quite do what it should. It's nice, but not 
ideal for wallpaper. And `xsetroot` doesn't work at all. Currently, 
if I log into i3 from KDM, I sometimes have the KDM wallpaper as my 
i3 wallpaper. Blech!

3) Had some weird corruption in the top left corner of my LH 
monitor (dual monitors) after:
a) leaving XFCE
b) started i3
c) had some clients running on the LH monitor
d) Switched that monitors container to &quot;stacked&quot; mode
e) Presto -- there was some sketchy weird remains of what looked 
like the XFCE taskbar I keep atop the screen.

My take on this is that it was due to uncleared video memory, but 
still the stacked-ness or something *should* have overwrote that 
chunk of memory at some point.. After moving some clients around 
some more, and/or changing to stacked/tabbed/default a few times, 
the weird stuff was gone. I've yet to reproduce it again.


4) Is it going to be possible to move the status bar (at bottom, 
where the workspaces are labeled) to the TOP of the screen? Or 
maybe have a keybind to toggle it on or off?

5) Can it be possible to switch to an EMPTY workspace? Like, if I 
have workspace 1 and 2 on my monitors, I would like to be able to 
switch to the &quot;3&quot; and &quot;4&quot; workspaces while they are empty, and 
start filling them up from empty. Perhaps if Xinerama is enabled, 
this switching action could either go in pairs, or one at a time? 
Poor description I think, but I have been awake for a long time 
fiddling with my i3 :-)

Anyhow, I know this is a lot for my first message, but I hope 
there's something either useful or interesting in it! Sorry I have 
rambled quite a bit -- next time I write, I'll keep it on one 
topic!!
