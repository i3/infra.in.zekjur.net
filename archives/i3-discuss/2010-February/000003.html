<PRE>Hi Sasha,

First of all: welcome and congratulations for the first post on
this mailing list ;-).

Excerpts from Sasha's message of Di Feb 02 21:53:34 +0100 2010:
&gt;<i> 0) I didn't BUILD the docs from source -- should I? Is there 
</I>&gt;<i> anything in there that isn't online or in the man page?
</I>If you are using the &quot;next&quot; branch: yes. If you are using a release
version: No, the documentation is the same as online.

&gt;<i> 1) Should I submit bugs (or whatever) to the TRAC site as an 
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous user? Seems silly. Can people subscribe/join the TRAC 
</I>&gt;<i> site?
</I>You can. The usual way for a bugreport is to be confirmed on IRC
(because of the quick nature of IRC it is easier to ask questions)
and then submit them to the bugtracker. I am not sure about the
subscription you mentioned, but we are not happy with trac at all.
There will be some work to replace it with something better in
some weeks.

&gt;<i> 2) I haven't noticed a way of doing wallpaper (background images) 
</I>&gt;<i> for i3. Currently, having searched around a fair bit, I'm using 
</I>&gt;<i> `feh` but it doesn't quite do what it should. It's nice, but not 
</I>&gt;<i> ideal for wallpaper. And `xsetroot` doesn't work at all. Currently, 
</I>&gt;<i> if I log into i3 from KDM, I sometimes have the KDM wallpaper as my 
</I>&gt;<i> i3 wallpaper. Blech!
</I>I use xdm which does not touch my wallpaper. After xdm asks me for
login/password, I use xsetroot in my .xsession, which works fine for
me. Other people also use &quot;feh&quot; or &quot;display&quot; (from ImageMagick).

&gt;<i> My take on this is that it was due to uncleared video memory, but 
</I>&gt;<i> still the stacked-ness or something *should* have overwrote that 
</I>&gt;<i> chunk of memory at some point.. After moving some clients around 
</I>&gt;<i> some more, and/or changing to stacked/tabbed/default a few times, 
</I>&gt;<i> the weird stuff was gone. I've yet to reproduce it again.
</I>I think this is a known bug (though there seems to be no ticket for
it). The stack window is not correctly redrawn under some
circumstances. I have to look into it an a few days&#8230;

&gt;<i> 4) Is it going to be possible to move the status bar (at bottom, 
</I>&gt;<i> where the workspaces are labeled) to the TOP of the screen? Or 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe have a keybind to toggle it on or off?
</I>It will be possible to turn it off in the next release, we plan to
replace it with dzen2 or a similar program.

&gt;<i> 5) Can it be possible to switch to an EMPTY workspace? Like, if I 
</I>&gt;<i> have workspace 1 and 2 on my monitors, I would like to be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> switch to the &quot;3&quot; and &quot;4&quot; workspaces while they are empty, and 
</I>&gt;<i> start filling them up from empty. Perhaps if Xinerama is enabled, 
</I>&gt;<i> this switching action could either go in pairs, or one at a time? 
</I>&gt;<i> Poor description I think, but I have been awake for a long time 
</I>&gt;<i> fiddling with my i3 :-)
</I>Ehm, sure, just switch to it? For the Xinerama part: it is a design
decision that workspace switches do *not* happen in pairs for
xinerama.

Best regards,
Michael
