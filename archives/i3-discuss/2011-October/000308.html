<PRE>hi,

oops, seems i've overlooked this mail

&gt;<i> I tried your patch with the default snap_threshold of 10 pixels. I noticed
</I>&gt;<i> multiple issues:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I can&#8217;t seem to position my windows within the 10 pixels to every screen
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; edge (e.g. I cannot position them at x=6, y=3). It always snaps. That is a
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; serious usability problem, but I don&#8217;t see a good way to solve it within the
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; existing i3 codebase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; A way that could work better (without having tried it): Signaling the user
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; that the window could snap. If you have ever used Apple Keynote or Xcode&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; User Interface Builder you know the helper lines they have to signal that
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; something can be aligned somewhere [1]. After signaling, the user could
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; either let the mouse button go (and the window would snap) or keep on
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; positioning and would be allowed to do it like he wants. As I said, I don&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; see how to implement this with i3&#8217;s codebase (in particular not without
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; using compositing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; Another way would be to press a specific key while dragging, like Control.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; Not sure if Control is a good choice for that, and also not sure if using it
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; together with the floating_modifier (which might already include Control
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; :-/) is a reasonable key combination to press.
</I>
yes, this is the way the snapping should work. snaps window on
specified threshold. i really don't like the way of 'signalling'
something to the user, it seems pretty ugly to me. the user should use
snapping or shouldn't. this is the way the most systems offer
(actually i haven't seen another way).

&gt;<i> 2) You don&#8217;t consider dock clients but always snap to the screen edges.
</I>
hmm, i can observe different bahaviour. i'm running i3bar this way:
i3bar -d bottom
and all the windows are respecting this border. have you got some
other informations about this?

&gt;<i> 3) There are various little code style points which I&#8217;m omitting in this mail,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; due to the reasons below.
</I>
i'm sorry :)

&gt;<i> Now that I saw how it looks and feels, I don&#8217;t think this is a good feature for
</I>&gt;<i> i3. It feels a little weird to use and frankly, I don&#8217;t think we need it.
</I>&gt;<i> Floating mode is mainly implemented for (modal) popup dialogs like password
</I>&gt;<i> prompts. i3 does not aim to become a good floating window manager.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, in conclusion: Thanks for your efforts, but I say no to this version of the
</I>&gt;<i> patch and probably also to further versions, unless you can convince me that
</I>&gt;<i> it&#8217;s really worth it and that you sorted out the usability problems.
</I>
ok, this is the beauty of open source. i have my own branch including
my patch and using/improving it (while trying to keep it in sync) and
i really enjoy using i3 this way

thanks for your hints ;)
maybe i'll try it later
jan
