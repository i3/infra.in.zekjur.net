<PRE>Hi Marco,

I think it might be easier than you think. The 'focus' property is a list of
container ids derived directly from the container struct in the core 
code. This
list is important for focus movement and structural changes to the tree 
such as
when a container is moved or closed.

For our purposes, the interesting properties of this list should be 1) The
length of the list is the number of containers on the workspace 
(corollary: an
empty list indicates the workspace is empty) 2) otherwise if the 
workspace is
focused, the id of the first container in the list represents the focused
container.

So this is very expressive, but a bit cryptic and not very well documented
outside of the testcases. It also plays to the primary strength of the
workspace reply object which is that no recursive tree-parsing is 
required so
it can be used with simple tools (in the ipc library, it is a simple two
function calls from the root to have the complete container object).

Would this implementation fit your use case?

</I>&gt;<i> If the reply should indicate the focused window as well, we would

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;windows&quot;:[
</I>&gt;<i>     {&quot;window&quot;: id1, &quot;focused&quot;: true},
</I>&gt;<i>     {&quot;window&quot;: id2, &quot;focused&quot;: false},
</I>&gt;<i>     ...
</I>&gt;<i> ]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> API-wise it could make sense to use the dump_node() function and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would like to see some tests that confirm that an empty array does 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indeed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indicate an empty workspace as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've already written several tests to ensure the implementation works 
</I>&gt;<i> as desired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, I would like this &quot;workspace&quot; member to be part of every window 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> event
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the new property of the &quot;workspace reply&quot; object to be included in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GET_WORKSPACE replies as well to maintain some consistency in the api.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As discussed. That's trivial because there is a central function that 
</I>&gt;<i> is used to create all window events.
