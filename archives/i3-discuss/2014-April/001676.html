<PRE>Hello Tony,

thanks for your detailed explanation.


 &gt; So this is very expressive, but a bit cryptic and not very well
 &gt; documented outside of the testcases. It also plays to the primary
 &gt; strength of the workspace reply object which is that no recursive
 &gt; tree-parsing is required so it can be used with simple tools.

The i3bar workspace parsing code still has to be adjusted because of its 
very strict nature. I was quite surprised that there was no i3bar when I 
first started i3 after my changes!


 &gt; Would this implementation fit your use case?

Yes, that would fit my use case perfectly well.

I was essentially doing the same thing, just using nodes_head and 
floating_head instead. But after adjusting the code to use focus_head, 
several test cases fail.

Problematic seems to be that I have to alter focus_head before the 
window close event is send, in order to get the correct window count. It 
worked just fine with the other mentioned data structures. I will try 
and see whether I can get it working again. If I can't, I will still 
post my working patch and we can go from there. Thanks.


Cheers,
   Marco
