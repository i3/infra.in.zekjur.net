<PRE>Hello Tony,

&gt;<i> I think sending the focus stack is a good idea because it could be used to
</I>&gt;<i> determine what window is focused (or focused-inactive) on the workspace.
</I>
My plan was to simply include the window ids of all opened X11 windows 
with WORKSPACE replies (ignoring all other nodes!):

&quot;windows&quot;:[id1, id2, ...]

This would make it (relatively) easy to determine whether a workspace is 
empty or not and be somewhat consistent with the TREE reply where each 
node provides a &quot;window&quot; field with the window id.

If the reply should indicate the focused window as well, we would either 
have to add another field. Or extend the array to not only include the 
window ids, but the focus state as well.

&quot;windows&quot;:[
     {&quot;window&quot;: id1, &quot;focused&quot;: true},
     {&quot;window&quot;: id2, &quot;focused&quot;: false},
     ...
]

API-wise it could make sense to use the dump_node() function and include 
the whole set of window properties. This would require additional code 
to deal with the protocol extension, though (i3bar is currently very 
strict when parsing the WORKSPACE reply).

Any thoughts?


&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to see some tests that confirm that an empty array does indeed
</I>&gt;<i> indicate an empty workspace as well.
</I>
I've already written several tests to ensure the implementation works as 
desired.


&gt;<i> Also, I would like this &quot;workspace&quot; member to be part of every window event
</I>&gt;<i> and the new property of the &quot;workspace reply&quot; object to be included in
</I>&gt;<i> GET_WORKSPACE replies as well to maintain some consistency in the api.
</I>
As discussed. That's trivial because there is a central function that is 
used to create all window events.

Cheers,
   Marco
