<PRE>Hi list,

I've been looking around for a while to get some sort of auto-completion
going for switching between temporary named workspaces. I'm currently using
i3-input, as such:

bindsym $mod+t exec i3-input -F 'workspace %s' -P 'Switch to: '

to allow me to switch between workspaces.

Now, this works completely fine, but becomes a bit cumbersome when you
want to give your workspaces more descriptive names.

My current idea (and I'm not sure if it's a terrible one or not, hence
this message), is to patch i3-input to allow some sort of shell-out
functionality. Let's consider a hypothetical -U option, which is
probably dependent on the -F option and which takes as
an argument any old string:

-U &lt;string&gt;

&lt;string&gt; here (likely a shell command), would be something that takes
the input (as provided by the user), does &quot;something&quot; with it, and
instead of interpolating the format string with the user input,
interpolates it with &lt;string&gt;'s output.

Reusing my binding from above, I'd like to do something similar to:

bindsym $mod+t exec i3-input -F 'workspace %s' -U '~/bin/autocomplete-i3-workspace %s'  -P 'Switch to: '

which executes the autocomplete-i3-workspace program, which in turn
returns a workspace autocompletion of my input, interpolates that into
the command and switches the workspace for me, without me having to type
the entire name of the workspace.

Possibly, you'd want some sort of checking of the exit code of the
subshell as well to allow for graceful handling of failures.

Am I making sense? Is this something that might be desirable for the
community in general? If so, what would you change about the proposal
outlined here? If not, is there a better way to do this already?

I've considered using dmenu to achieve basically the same thing. if I
remember correctly, I once had a wmii setup like that, but I wanted to
run the idea by you all first, and hear your input, since I feel like
it'd be a neat feature to have built-in.

Anton
