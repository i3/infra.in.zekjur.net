<PRE>Hello guys,

First of all, thanks for this great window manager.  I have been using
it for almost 1 week now, and so far it has been really great!

Well, my question has actually been already asked on IRC, but I didn't
have much time to continue the conversation there.  I am using
xfce4-notifyd as my notification daemon, and I've been struggling with
it to get it working properly.  But whenever a notification comes up,
the notification window is displayed in the center of the screen.  I
have always used/configured xfce4-notifyd to make it appear in the top
right, but somehow it's not working with i3.

Some guy (I think it was Fernando) told me that xfce4-notifyd is buggy
regarding to windows' hints, and advised me to use notify-osd instead.
I would happily do that, but I'm on Fedora and (a) I don't have a
package for that and (b) when I tried to compile, I discovered that I
would have to compile another packages for dependencies (because Fedora
also doesn't provide the necessary versions of those).  Anyway, my
question is: is there any way to make xfce4-notifyd work properly and
display notifications wherever I tell it to?

Thank you!
