<PRE>Hi all,

I'm using Debian squeeze (6.0.4), which is the stable version of
Debian. The i3 package from the official package repository is very
old (3.e) and it will not be updated until next Debian major release.

So I cloned the i3 source, and tried to build it. Some of the
dependent package names listed in the DEPENDS file does not exist in
the stable repository, after some trial and error attempts to grab
dependent packages, I built the package &quot;i3-wm_4.1.2-2_i386.deb&quot; from
the master branch and installed it.

Everything works except that gitk and urxvt do not cooperate well.
When I'm in the urxvt shell, and fire up gitk, then I close gitk (by
pressing Ctrl-W), the starting shell window has no focus and won't
respond to input. And even after I clicked the urxvt window with
mouse, the keyboard strokes still won't be captured by the terminal,
but the mouse can select text, by the way.

The only way to make the terminal aware of keyboard input is switching
to another window or another workspace and then switch back.

I also built the latest urxvt from Debian sid source
(rxvt-unicode_9.15-1_i386.deb), the gitk version is 1.7.2.5-3 (shown
from dpkg -l gitk).

This problem has been annoying me for a long time since I started to
use the latest i3-wm other than the antique one from the stable
repository. And some other programs used to have the same issue but
most of them seemed to be gone (and I don't remember them now anyway)
and now the only case I can confront is &quot;urxvt&quot; and &quot;gitk&quot;.

I use both &quot;mrxvt&quot; and &quot;urxvt&quot; (for either multi-tab support or
unicode support...), and &quot;mrxvt&quot; does not have such problem with
&quot;gitk&quot;. Actually any program I used to launch from mrxvt terminal did
not cause this problem.
