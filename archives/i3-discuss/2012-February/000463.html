&gt;<i> At first BIG thanks for authors for creating such an excellent
</I>&gt;<i> product!
</I>
i++ :-)

&gt;<i> I would like to share my 1-week experience here, because I think it is
</I>&gt;<i> relevant for authours to understand what/how novices think. My
</I>&gt;<i> impressions
</I>&gt;<i> are fresh now, but the more I became used to, the less I will notice
</I>&gt;<i> the small but important differencies which novice users need.
</I>
Nice to read, what other users are thinking, thx. I remember my first
week with i3. I never use a tiling WM before and know I can't without.

&gt;<i> Things I've noticed:
</I>[...]
&gt;<i> 2) &quot;Resize&quot; section of default config file is too complicated. I've come
</I>&gt;<i>     with much better solution for me, it is very easy to remember:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # resize
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Left            resize shrink   right 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Right           resize grow     right 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>[...]

Same here. I skip entering resize mode, and do it directly like you.

&gt;<i> 4) [minor] I can not find the shortcut for Alt-Tab. Simple, this
</I>&gt;<i> should be ability
</I>&gt;<i>     to cycle windows on current desktop. Most of newcoming users would feel
</I>&gt;<i>     bad without it.
</I>
I use Alt-Tab in this way and I like it.

  ## switching workspace
  bindsym Mod1+Tab workspace back_and_forth

But I agree, sometimes it would be nice to switch between the last two
windows.

&gt;<i> 5) [minor] Floating mode for the whole desktop.
</I>
Nice to have, but I don't need it really.

&gt;<i> 6) *Always* pressing Modkey+H, Modkey+V before every next program open is
</I>&gt;<i>     overkill. I think more smart would be to cycle this. Why? Because now every
</I>&gt;<i>     next window open always have bigger ratio X*Y where it is comfortable to
</I>&gt;<i>     work
</I>&gt;<i>     with apps in square. So, what I mean, exactly, I think it would be helpful
</I>&gt;<i>     if:
</I>&gt;<i>       6.1. Mod+enter - opens terminal on full screen
</I>&gt;<i>       6.2. Mod+enter - opens terminal split vertically
</I>&gt;<i>       6.3. Mod+enter (without Modkey+v) opens new terminal split horizontally
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> etc... Because I always tend to do it this way. I don't see big necessity
</I>&gt;<i> to open tall narrow terminals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     6.4. Next one should open horizontally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like we come up to somehow called 'spiral' layout, but its
</I>&gt;<i> smarter because
</I>&gt;<i> when you switch to other window, it would continue splitting this way.
</I>
I wouldn't like it. I want *my* layout and *no* rule. ;-) I have no
problem with hitting &#167;mod-v to put the third terminal under the second.
For more complex layouts shell scripts can do a good job.
