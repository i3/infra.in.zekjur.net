Hi Fernando &amp; All,

Yes, agree with above said by you. I am novice user, and posted only my
first week impressions, most of them could be unrelevant or misconcepts.

Example: making full support for floating would be 'nice to have' but...
I *do* understand that may add too much crap to the code, and probably 
authors are not interested in that at all at this stage, especially when 
its being very optional. So, please dont pay much attention to all what 
I've said. I only  mentioned it because I wanted to express 'general' 
feel, without paying atttention on how difficult (or conceptually) it 
would be to get it implemented.

Based on your comments vote for two things:

  1) Still I think it would be very good for the Alt-Tab support.

Let me explain my necessity in it:

Where I find it *very* useful that i3 does remember the active window
in the current container, I still will have to press more keys then
in other WM when I need to work between two windows located
on different sides of the screen:

For example I have a very big 27&quot; panel, where I place
applications in 4 rows. Using cursor navigation between windows
would take longer, then using alt-tab to switch between last 2 used apps.
I am not very big fan of mouse, and try to use it only in this kind
of corner situations. It would help if I have only one screen (and for example
moving focus out of screen would go round to left side) but when there
are multiple big screens connected, focus would go there.

Cycle windows using Alt-Tab, based on history of last active window
would solve this easily, and less keypresses (or mouse movements)
will be needed.

  2) Smart container auto-split. That feature may be optional. Now,
I think I will stay with the following: after new app open, I *always* should
specify manually how the next application will split the current container.
Lets see if I can get this habit. Because what happens now is that a lot
of windows open (chat windows, etc) usaully in wrong direction, and I almost
always have to relocate or re-split the container and relocate window
back to correct location.

&gt;<i> It would be nice if you or anyone wrote articles about i3, but I'd
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that you take your time adapting to how things work with i3
</I>&gt;<i> first.
</I>
Yes, agree. Writing good article also requires good time. I hope to get
it done properly after a few more weeks by using this fantastic program!
Thank you and all above commented on my initial response :-)
