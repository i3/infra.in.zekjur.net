<PRE>HI,

On Thu, Feb 2, 2012 at 4:39 AM, Alex V. Koval &lt;<A HREF="http://infra.in.zekjur.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/i3-discuss">alex at ua2web.com</A>&gt; wrote:

Section 2.2 mentions the stacking layout:

Perhaps it could be expanded. If you think you can improve it, please
let us know, submit patches, etc.


&gt;<i> 2) &quot;Resize&quot; section of default config file is too complicated. I've come
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;with much better solution for me, it is very easy to remember:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> # resize
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Left &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;resize shrink &#160; right 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Right &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; resize grow &#160; &#160; right 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Right &#160; resize shrink &#160; left 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Left &#160; &#160;resize grow &#160; &#160; left 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Up &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;resize shrink &#160; down 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Down &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;resize grow &#160; &#160; down 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Down &#160; &#160;resize shrink &#160; up 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Up &#160; &#160; &#160;resize grow &#160; &#160; up 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. May be I just don't get the defaule resize mode. I've tried
</I>&gt;<i> it a few times and later just disabled it because were unable to learn
</I>&gt;<i> it fast.
</I>
Resizing with the keyboard is complicated. We have some ideas to
provide simpler resizing with the keyboard in the bugtracker:

<A HREF="http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/576">http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/576</A>

We don't use 2-modifier bindings in the default config. I'm guessing
here, but I think there are two reasons for that. First, it would
probably complicate things. Second, we ask the user what modifier he'd
like to use in the config wizard, and thus using 2-modifier bindings
wouldn't make much sense.

Whether using 2-modifier bindings in the default config would make
things easier or not is completely subjective, and I don't see the
default bindings for resizing changing unless we introduce different
ways to resize. I could argue that the bindings I set up for my laptop
are clearly better, but that doesn't mean they should be the default
bindings. :-)


&gt;<i> 3) [minor issue ]Modkey + jkl - difficult to re-learn after xmonad,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;awesome and others which have assigned different meanings for those keys
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;by default
</I>
Kind of personal taste too, no?


&gt;<i> 4) [minor] I can not find the shortcut for Alt-Tab. Simple, this should be
</I>&gt;<i> ability
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;to cycle windows on current desktop. Most of newcoming users would feel
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;bad without it.
</I>
There's no such concept in i3, as focus follows the tree hierarchy.
Using any tiled window manager requires learning, unfortunately, and
i3 is no different. That said, if you're considering implementing
this, please ping Michael first to see if he would accept it.


&gt;<i> 5) [minor] Floating mode for the whole desktop. Let me explain. Tiling &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> stacking
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;are very good for hard work, where all space is occupied
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;by different windows. But there are situations when I don't need
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;this. Sometimes I want to see my nice background and a few floating
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;windows over it. It would be good to have such a mode for desktop,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;as a fallback for a typical user to normal work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;The other argument: I use to put very nice background on my desktop,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;and would never see it if I always work in tiling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;It is also _very_ important IMO if we would ever have floating
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;mode for desktop, it should support 'smart' window placement. I've
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;explained
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;what I mean in this video: <A HREF="http://youtu.be/eS-mchtzJsg">http://youtu.be/eS-mchtzJsg</A> but generally it
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;means
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;the following: place window in biggest onuccupied space on current
</I>&gt;<i> screen.
</I>
That's probably not going to happen, as Michael already stated in the
past. i3 is a pure tiling window manager, floating exists mostly for
popups and compatibility with the occasional broken application.

The snapping behavior has been shot down already in the past:

<A HREF="http://infra.in.zekjur.net/pipermail/i3-discuss/2011-September/000286.html">http://infra.in.zekjur.net/pipermail/i3-discuss/2011-September/000286.html</A>

Also, using the &quot;beautiful desktop background&quot; argument will get you
nowhere. i3 prioritizes functionality over form, and thus a point like
this is never going to be taken seriously. If you want to see a
beautiful image, use a image viewer or switch to an empty workspace.
:<i>-P
</I>

&gt;<i> 6) *Always* pressing Modkey+H, Modkey+V before every next program open is
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;overkill. I think more smart would be to cycle this. Why? Because now
</I>&gt;<i> every
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;next window open always have bigger ratio X*Y where it is comfortable to
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;work
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;with apps in square. So, what I mean, exactly, I think it would be
</I>&gt;<i> helpful
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;if:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;6.1. Mod+enter - opens terminal on full screen
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;6.2. Mod+enter - opens terminal split vertically
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;6.3. Mod+enter (without Modkey+v) opens new terminal split horizontally
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> etc... Because I always tend to do it this way. I don't see big necessity
</I>&gt;<i> to open tall narrow terminals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;6.4. Next one should open horizontally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like we come up to somehow called 'spiral' layout, but its smarter
</I>&gt;<i> because
</I>&gt;<i> when you switch to other window, it would continue splitting this way.
</I>
Just some clarification. You only need to split before opening a
client *if* you want to split the current container. You could argue
that the spiral layout you're describing forces one to &quot;unsplit&quot;
before launching a client, which would be rather &quot;unproductive&quot; too if
that is not what you wanted to do, naturally.

What you describe is the Awesome spiral layout. i3, on the other hand,
works by making you manage the layout by splitting, resizing and
moving containers around in a tree structure. It's a different
behavior, I don't see that changing. In the future, you might be able
to restore from a previously-saved (or manually composed) layout. That
might be enough for your needs.


&gt;<i> 7) Its very pity that dmenu does not remember previous choice. It would be
</I>&gt;<i> great
</I>&gt;<i> to improve this part of dmenu.
</I>
Yeah, as it's already been mentioned, dmenu is a separate project,
created and maintained by different people. Please ping them with
suggestions about dmenu (it's part of the Suckless project/community).


&gt;<i> 8) Until there are serious bugs remain, like dying tray applications (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/550">http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/550</A>) it would be diffcult to advertize
</I>&gt;<i> i3. I am upset that such great window manager still don't get great
</I>&gt;<i> public attention (like I don't see it in Google Trends), but may be its not
</I>&gt;<i> a right time. When everything will be very stable, I will try publish an
</I>&gt;<i> article about it in habr (21523 readers) for russian speaking ppl.
</I>
We are very aware of the bugs in i3 (after all, that's why we track
them in the bugtracker). If you can reproduce #550 (or any other bug
that needs attention), please post relevant information in the
bugtracker.

It would be nice if you or anyone wrote articles about i3, but I'd
suggest that you take your time adapting to how things work with i3
first.

Regards,
</PRE>
