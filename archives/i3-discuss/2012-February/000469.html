<PRE>I'm trying to get a certain behavior out of I3. As an example, lets say I'd
like to have a firefox browser window on workspace 3, a chromium browser
window on workspace 9 , etc.  * However, I do not want to launch another
firefox again and have it also appear on workspace 3 *.

For some reason, each firefox has the same WM_CLASS class / instance fields
on my debian system. Too bad they didn't append natural numbers to each
instance: firefox1 for the first, firefox2 for the second , etc. This is
not a problem with some of the terminal emulator's  e.g. gnome-terminal
lets you set the WM_NAME window name, it remains static,  and we can assign
to that. I tried using exec xprop -name ..... -set name .....  to set the
window name for the browsers from the config file, but i get no such
window. I believe this is because the window name changes, as mentioned in
the user guide.

 I can think of two ways to get my desired behavior to work. One  would be
a on_workspace command which I would add to the config file and its
signature would be &quot;on_workspace 9 exec chromium&quot; or something similar,
with the expected behavior launching a chromium browser on workspace 9.
Another way would be to change the exec command to pass back the window id,
however I'm not sure this is possible, and it doesn't seem to go with the
design plan for i3.  Can anybody suggest a way to achieve the behavior I'm
looking for, or give me a pointer on how to implement the feature myself?
