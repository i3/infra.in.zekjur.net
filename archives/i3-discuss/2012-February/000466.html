<PRE>Hi Alex,

Excerpts from Alex V. Koval's message of 2012-02-03 06:29:42 +0000:
&gt;<i>   1) Still I think it would be very good for the Alt-Tab support.
</I>I find the concept of alt-tab horrible. In its usual implementation (like it is
implemented in Windows, Mac OS X, GNOME, &#8230;), it either requires you to remember
where focus was before, or you end up in the wrong window. Now, most of the
mentioned implementations also display some kind of window list to make this
more deterministic, but that requires additional hand-eye-coordination, which
i3 attempts to get rid of (mostly).

Therefore, I don&#8217;t want to have an alt-tab-like feature. Most users get used to
using the direction keys just fine.

&gt;<i>   2) Smart container auto-split. That feature may be optional. Now,
</I>&gt;<i> I think I will stay with the following: after new app open, I *always* should
</I>&gt;<i> specify manually how the next application will split the current container.
</I>&gt;<i> Lets see if I can get this habit. Because what happens now is that a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of windows open (chat windows, etc) usaully in wrong direction, and I almost
</I>&gt;<i> always have to relocate or re-split the container and relocate window
</I>&gt;<i> back to correct location.
</I>Hm, I usually set my workspaces to stacked layout (unless I&#8217;m using very big
monitors) and then break out of that (by using focus parent and opening a new
window) when necessary. For more advanced rules, like splitting based on the
amount of windows / space used, I would recommend writing external scripts, but
I&#8217;m not quite sure how exactly that could be done from the top of my head :).

If we forgot to reply to any of your points, please let us know. The list was
pretty long :).

Best regards,
Michael
