Hi Michael,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   1) Still I think it would be very good for the Alt-Tab support.
</I>&gt;<i> I find the concept of alt-tab horrible. In its usual implementation (like it is
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in Windows, Mac OS X, GNOME, ???), it either requires you to remember
</I>&gt;<i> where focus was before, or you end up in the wrong window.
</I>
The best alt-tab implementation along all the WMs was here:
<A HREF="http://fluxbox-wiki.org/index.php/Keyboard_shortcuts">http://fluxbox-wiki.org/index.php/Keyboard_shortcuts</A>
0 or unspecified = Default/current behavior - no skipping
1 cycle groups
2 skip stuck windows
4 skip shaded windows
8 cycle linear (use the same order every time)

Of course bitmasks would have different meanings for i3 (like insetad of 
cycle windows we would cycle history or cycle linear), but the general
idea behind that is that end user configure what he thinks is more 
appropriate.

&gt;<i> Now, most of the
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned implementations also display some kind of window list to make this
</I>&gt;<i> more deterministic, but that requires additional hand-eye-coordination, which
</I>&gt;<i> i3 attempts to get rid of (mostly).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, I don???t want to have an alt-tab-like feature. Most users get used to
</I>&gt;<i> using the direction keys just fine.
</I>
No problem, I will use it as-is anyway. Well, that is a minor issue ;-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   2) Smart container auto-split. That feature may be optional. Now,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think I will stay with the following: after new app open, I *always* should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specify manually how the next application will split the current container.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lets see if I can get this habit. Because what happens now is that a lot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of windows open (chat windows, etc) usaully in wrong direction, and I almost
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always have to relocate or re-split the container and relocate window
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back to correct location.
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, I usually set my workspaces to stacked layout (unless I???m using very big
</I>&gt;<i> monitors) and then break out of that (by using focus parent and opening a new
</I>&gt;<i> window) when necessary. For more advanced rules, like splitting based on the
</I>&gt;<i> amount of windows / space used, I would recommend writing external scripts, but
</I>&gt;<i> I???m not quite sure how exactly that could be done from the top of my head :).
</I>
Yah, for one week experience I am not yet started with scripting here, 
probably this will start after at least a few months, and only if I find
that I am missing something important.

Thank you &amp; have a good day!

Best Regards,
