<PRE>Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At first BIG thanks for authors for creating such an excellent product!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to share my 1-week experience here, because I think it
</I>&gt;<i> is relevant for authours to understand what/how novices think. My
</I>&gt;<i> impressions
</I>&gt;<i> are fresh now, but the more I became used to, the less I will notice
</I>&gt;<i> the small but important differencies which novice users need.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I explain is neigher critics, neither wishes to implement. It

</I>&gt;<i> judgement
</I>&gt;<i> and conclusions if anything from said below is important for you
</I>&gt;<i> and strategically for i3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Things I've noticed:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) There are no good explation of stacking mode in the video screencast
</I>&gt;<i>     and docs.
</I>        I found the documentation pretty easy to follow and understand, 
        but then again never used stacking mode.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) &quot;Resize&quot; section of default config file is too complicated. I've come
</I>&gt;<i>     with much better solution for me, it is very easy to remember:
</I>
        +1, but on the other hand, resizing for me has always involved 
        the mouse.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # resize
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Left            resize shrink   right 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Right           resize grow     right 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Right   resize shrink   left 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Left    resize grow     left 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Up              resize shrink   down 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Down            resize grow     down 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Down    resize shrink   up 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> bindsym Mod4+Mod1+Control+Up      resize grow     up 3 px or 3 ppt
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. May be I just don't get the defaule resize mode. I've tried
</I>&gt;<i> it a few times and later just disabled it because were unable to learn
</I>&gt;<i> it fast.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) [minor issue ]Modkey + jkl - difficult to re-learn after xmonad,
</I>&gt;<i>     awesome and others which have assigned different meanings for those keys
</I>&gt;<i>     by default
</I>
        I also come from 3 years of using xmonad, but the ModKey+jkl;?
        is there as well enabled by default (see bellow).

        You can cycle windows wih ``vi'' like bindings. 
        The only thing which is weird is because ModKey+h is bind 
        to horiz split.

        Maybe here we can enable a default ``vi'' window splitting as
        well ? (binding ModKey+s for horiz and ModKey+v for vertical 
        -- though I think I had to replace other modifier as it was
        already taken).

        This the key word here is default configuration, by default
        I mean the simplest configuration file you can have -- if
        for instance I delete my configuration file, i3 should
        assume implicit values as explained in the manual.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) [minor] I can not find the shortcut for Alt-Tab. Simple, this
</I>&gt;<i> should be ability
</I>&gt;<i>     to cycle windows on current desktop. Most of newcoming users would feel
</I>&gt;<i>     bad without it.
</I>        +1, at first was pressing this pretty intensive, it seems I
        never realized until ``now'' how much I used that.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) [minor] Floating mode for the whole desktop. Let me explain.
</I>&gt;<i> Tiling &amp; stacking
</I>&gt;<i>     are very good for hard work, where all space is occupied
</I>&gt;<i>     by different windows. But there are situations when I don't need
</I>&gt;<i>     this. Sometimes I want to see my nice background and a few floating
</I>&gt;<i>     windows over it. It would be good to have such a mode for desktop,
</I>&gt;<i>     as a fallback for a typical user to normal work.
</I>
        I think floating should be ``enabled'' before window/container 
        creation -- let's say I want this workspace to have floating 
        mode switch to that then all windows in that workspace can be
        smartly sized placed.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The other argument: I use to put very nice background on my desktop,
</I>&gt;<i>     and would never see it if I always work in tiling.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     It is also _very_ important IMO if we would ever have floating
</I>&gt;<i>     mode for desktop, it should support 'smart' window placement. I've
</I>&gt;<i>     explained
</I>&gt;<i>     what I mean in this video: <A HREF="http://youtu.be/eS-mchtzJsg">http://youtu.be/eS-mchtzJsg</A> but generally it
</I>&gt;<i>     means
</I>&gt;<i>     the following: place window in biggest onuccupied space on current screen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6) *Always* pressing Modkey+H, Modkey+V before every next program open is
</I>&gt;<i>     overkill. I think more smart would be to cycle this. Why? Because now every
</I>&gt;<i>     next window open always have bigger ratio X*Y where it is comfortable to
</I>&gt;<i>     work
</I>&gt;<i>     with apps in square. So, what I mean, exactly, I think it would be helpful
</I>&gt;<i>     if:
</I>&gt;<i>       6.1. Mod+enter - opens terminal on full screen
</I>&gt;<i>       6.2. Mod+enter - opens terminal split vertically
</I>&gt;<i>       6.3. Mod+enter (without Modkey+v) opens new terminal split horizontally
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> etc... Because I always tend to do it this way. I don't see big necessity
</I>&gt;<i> to open tall narrow terminals.
</I>
        I also vote on this, but I have to say that after some
        time, I find it more normal/natural this way, as you arrange 
        your layout as you may seem fit -- but of course having a
        default ``smart'' spiral layout sounds great, the issue for
        me here would be to keep this layout after windows/containers
        are destroyed not having to do it all over again.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     6.4. Next one should open horizontally.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like we come up to somehow called 'spiral' layout, but its
</I>&gt;<i> smarter because
</I>&gt;<i> when you switch to other window, it would continue splitting this way.
</I>
        You have consistent behaviour which we humans seem to value
        and care.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 7) Its very pity that dmenu does not remember previous choice. It
</I>&gt;<i> would be great
</I>&gt;<i> to improve this part of dmenu.
</I>
        Unfortunately suckless-tools is another project.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 8) Until there are serious bugs remain, like dying tray applications (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/550">http://bugs.i3wm.org/report/ticket/550</A>) it would be diffcult to advertize
</I>&gt;<i> i3. I am upset that such great window manager still don't get great
</I>&gt;<i> public attention (like I don't see it in Google Trends), but may be
</I>&gt;<i> its not a right time. When everything will be very stable, I will
</I>&gt;<i> try publish an article about it in habr (21523 readers) for russian
</I>&gt;<i> speaking ppl.
</I>
        Never had this issue, and it seems stable enough to go
        from a 3 year xmonad productive configuration in just
        a day pretty nice.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, please don't treat this as critics, no way! You have created
</I>&gt;<i> one of the greatest products around, and I hope that my first impressions
</I>&gt;<i> will tell you something about new users mind :)
</I>
        I do feel the same way, great job!
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
