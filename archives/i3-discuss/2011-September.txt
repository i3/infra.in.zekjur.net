Yeah, the goto command was just 'goto' in previous versions (and I think of
re-introducing an alias), so that was never an issue there ;).

Yep.

The best way of course would be to fix i3-input, probably accepting a format
string and replacing %c for command.

For the readers of this mailing list, there is a ticket which includes a patch:

Indeed, I can reproduce that (open 'display' in a floating window, the floating
window will end up having a smaller rectangle than the app requested).

One of the problems with ImageMagick?s initial geometry seems to be that it is
not multi-monitor aware. However, judging from your logfile, you only have a
single monitor with 1280x1024 pixels. I?m not sure why ImageMagick requests
(640,640)?

Hi Jan,

Thanks for your patch, sorry for taking so long to respond.

Excerpts from Jan Krcmar's message of 2011-08-26 10:58:31 +0200:
> now, the windows are snapping while moving and while resizing
> 
> i've also pushed the new configuration option into the config file
> determining the edge snap threshold
I tried your patch with the default snap_threshold of 10 pixels. I noticed
multiple issues:

1) I can?t seem to position my windows within the 10 pixels to every screen
   edge (e.g. I cannot position them at x=6, y=3). It always snaps. That is a
   serious usability problem, but I don?t see a good way to solve it within the
   existing i3 codebase.

   A way that could work better (without having tried it): Signaling the user
   that the window could snap. If you have ever used Apple Keynote or Xcode?s
   User Interface Builder you know the helper lines they have to signal that
   something can be aligned somewhere [1]. After signaling, the user could
   either let the mouse button go (and the window would snap) or keep on
   positioning and would be allowed to do it like he wants. As I said, I don?t
   see how to implement this with i3?s codebase (in particular not without
   using compositing).

   Another way would be to press a specific key while dragging, like Control.
   Not sure if Control is a good choice for that, and also not sure if using it
   together with the floating_modifier (which might already include Control
   :-/) is a reasonable key combination to press.

2) You don?t consider dock clients but always snap to the screen edges.

3) There are various little code style points which I?m omitting in this mail,
   due to the reasons below.

Now that I saw how it looks and feels, I don?t think this is a good feature for
i3. It feels a little weird to use and frankly, I don?t think we need it.
Floating mode is mainly implemented for (modal) popup dialogs like password
prompts. i3 does not aim to become a good floating window manager.

So, in conclusion: Thanks for your efforts, but I say no to this version of the
patch and probably also to further versions, unless you can convince me that
it?s really worth it and that you sorted out the usability problems.

Best regards,
Michael

I always get a (640,640) position from ImageMagick for my single monitor
setup. According to the documentation the default offset should be +0+0
and this seems to work fine on wmii.

Hi all, anyone have any experience setting up i3 with i3status on
Ubuntu 10.04?  10.04's default libasound2 is 1.0.22:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  i3status: Depends: libasound2 (> 1.0.24.1) but 1.0.22-0ubuntu7 is installed.

Doesn't look like libasound2 will get updated for 10.04 past 1.0.22:

https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/i386/libasound2

Anyone have any workarounds or fixes for getting i3status working in 10.04?

Thanks,
Byron

Hi,

I have set up the default_orientation configuration parameter to
vertical and I would expect that when I open a terminal it would always
appear below the current one. However for a workspace with left and
right terminals, when focus is on the right one, a new terminal appears
to the right. If I press mod+v before opening a new terminal then it is
created below the right terminal as expected. Is the default_orientation
parameter supposed to define the orientation for all containers in the
workspace?

Thanks,
Miguel

No, it?s not. It is the *default* orientation of the workspace, when a
workspace will be created. So, if you change the workspace?s orientation (for
example by moving windows to the left/right), the default_orientation does not
matter anymore.

Subject: [i3] Switching workspaces when mouse touch the border of it
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.2.02.1109241252120.24084@myhost>

Hi all,
I want i3 to switch the workspace when I move the mouse pointer at the 
border of the screen. It should then get to the next/prev workspace, warp the 
pointer to the "oposit x" position and set the container beneath active.

Here is some sloppy code to show you what I mean:

diff --git a/src/handlers.c b/src/handlers.c
index 6b79ed4..87bca5b 100644
--- a/src/handlers.c
+++ b/src/handlers.c
@@ -259,6 +259,20 @@ static int 
handle_motion_notify(xcb_motion_notify_event_t *event) {
          return 1;
      }

+    /* see if we need to switch the workspace */
+    if (0 == event->root_x) {
+        workspace_prev();
+        xcb_warp_pointer(conn, XCB_NONE, root, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
root_screen->width_in_pixels-2, event->root_y);
+    }
+
+    if (root_screen->width_in_pixels-1 <= event->root_x) {
+        workspace_next();
+        xcb_warp_pointer(conn, XCB_NONE, root, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 
event->root_y);
+    }
+
+    /* refresh the screen */
+    tree_render();
+
      return 1;
  }

This code of course does not set the container active and has some more 
disadvantages. I can only test the behaviour on a single screen computer 
because I do not own one with two screens. So if you have a dual screen 
set up it might drive you crazy ;)

Can you give me some advice on how to implement this feature best. It 
might also be a good idea to make it an option. How should I call that 
option?

Best regards,
Bernhard

Hi Bernhard,

Thanks for your willingness to implement a new feature.

However, I am not convinced that this is actually a good feature, for the
following reasons:

1) i3 is a tiling window manager, not a floating window manager. Therefore,
   actually seeing the desktop should be a rare occasion, such as when
   rebooting your computer. In general, windows will always fill your screen.

   As we only get PointerMotion events (== the mouse pointer moved) when the
   pointer is above one of our windows, this implies that the feature would
   only work in the rare case of not having any windows. Then again, workspaces
   don?t exist when there are no windows on them, so that would not make sense
   at all.

   To actually get PointerMotion events all the time, you would need to grab
   the pointer, then decide if you want to handle the event or pass it to the
   client. This is not very performant and sounds like it might introduce new,
   subtle bugs (based on my experience).

2) Not so much a technical reason, but more a philosophical one: One of i3?s
   goals is to provide an efficient user interface for power users. While using
   the mouse pointer is faster for user interfaces / programs with which you
   are not familiar (I can lookup the study if you want to), it is certainly
   not faster as soon as keyboard shortcuts end up in your muscle memory.
   Therefore, the primary input device when using i3 should be the keyboard. 

In conclusion, I don?t think the feature you propose could be easily
implemented nor would it make a lot of sense. An alternative which comes to my
mind is a shortcut that works similar to the floating_modifier: Pressing some
modifier and using the scroll wheel to change workspaces. For this, I would
want to have a more generic "what should happen when I press mouse button X in
situation Y" configuration.

Best regards,
Michael

I would be interested to see this study, not because I disagree but rather
because I'd like to learn more about the experimental conditions.

And Michael, thanks for i3. Though I didn't know until I used it, tree based
management is what I've been wishing my interfaces to work like whether I
was using a traditional or tiling wm. Bernhard, I suggest you try exploring
the i3 way some more and then decide if its right for you. At this point you
can basically see every libre wm as materially opinionated, and it doesn't
make sense to stick to one that doesn't agree with your idea of a workflow.

It will not change the primary interface "the keyboard" but I do not want 
to start a useless flamewar. I will stop to develop this feature 
in public and use in private only :)

Hi John,
I already explorded i3 and I like it. For _me_ it is lacking this feature 
(and some other). I can self decide what I use and what not. I am also 
able to implement the missing features myself. As I always do when I implement 
something I try to share it and ask the mainline people how to implement 
it better because in my experience the mainline people allways knows 
their code best.

So I will stick to i3 + patches :)

Best regard,
Bernhard

Of course you have the freedom to do that. Nevertheless, the hint that you
might want to re-evaluate how you use i3 is appropriate, since you clearly want
a feature which does not really fit into our concept :).

Well, a few hints on how to implement this:
 ? Check out grabbing, see for example drag_pointer() in src/floating.c. You
   will probably need to grab the pointer in order to always receive
   PointerMotion events.
 ??You have to get a bit more familiar with the tree. checking the root window
   size is not appropriate for finding out how big your screen(s) are. Just
   recursively go to the parent until you find the appropriate containers (type
   == CT_OUTPUT).
 ? Also, use con_focus() instead of pointer warping.

Best regards,
Michael

Thanks for your advice I will dig deeper into the suggested code :)

Subject: [i3] i3status not showing in i3bar
Message-ID: <20110925100309.1e9142a8@sid>

I am using Debian sid with i3wm 4.0.2-1 and i3 status 2.3-2 . I am
using the default settings and should be seeing the information from
i3status.conf in the 13bar, but nothing is seen. I really only want the
time and date and deleting all the unwanted information does give a
display but still includes IPV6 and other unwanted stuff. The default
config is different between the docs and supplied file with no
output_format = option on the supplied version. I have tried with and
without this option I have also tried the latest version from your
repros. Finally when shutting down the status information briefly 
appears. 

Thanks

You could try using output_format = none (it should be automatically detected,
though).

Make sure to use order = "time" then (not order += "time").

Thank you Michael, that fixed it, I think I may have left the "+" in
the previous config.

I had tried the "output_format = none" but it makes no difference.

I didn't mean to imply that you're approach is unreasonable, only that it
does not seem to fit into the usage model and philosophy of i3. In such a
case, perhaps there is a more appropriate wm out there. Then again, as you
say, perhaps not.

That said, I am just as interested in how you are interfacing, given that
you like i3 but would seem to like it to be more mouse-centric, as I am in
the research that Michael mentioned earlier. I for one do not believe in
there being 'only one way to do it' for HID and am always curious about
encountering new diversity.

Please consider sharing your patches back out to the community. I certainly
wasn't intending to engage in flaming in any way, and I don't think
flamewars will erupt if you publish you patches.
