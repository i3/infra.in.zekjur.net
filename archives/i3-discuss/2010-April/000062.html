<PRE>Those issues sound to me as if they have more to do with your urxvtc script and firefox rather than i3 and you should probably ask about what is going on with them in the&#160;arch forum.

Also, the &quot;i3 welcome message&quot; is instructions for how to use i3....

Running  minimal system is a bit harder than the point and click things..
You're getting closer to the nuts and bolts of your computer...

&quot;I'd recommend you NOT click the OK button of the welcome message.&quot; - Ooops.
Yes, you are right I didn't read the message. I read a lot before, all kind of information what was on the web page.
And looking through I
 thought, that it's all I know already.




Then two other issues remain. I'll just repeat what I wrote before:
I have found two more issues:

1) When I used my script for starting urxvt instead of directly doing 
this, everything also hanged. The script is:

#!/bin/sh
urxvtc 
&quot;$@&quot;
if [ $? -eq 2 ]; then
urxvtd -q -o -f
urxvtc &quot;$@&quot;

fi

*note: this has no problems working with awesome.

2) 
When I killed a firefox (from console), which was alone on the tag, the 
tag was destroyed, but again everything was hanging.

Especially the second issue is irritating.

It sounds to me from &quot;description 1-9 below&quot; that i3 is behaving as it should..
example: &quot;4) Click on the &quot;ok&quot; button on the message&quot;



Do you read the message before you click ok?

you don't need to click the &quot;ok button&quot; of the Welcome message to continue using i3.
Futhurmore, I'd recommend you NOT click the OK button of the welcome message.

I tried that, but i3 didn't react.
In fact I could see (switching
 back to Alt-F7) only black window with mouse cursor on it.
The full description of what I did:
1) start i3
2) see the welcome message
3) do not touching it I try to see whether window manager reacts on keys and it is (OK)




4) Click on the &quot;ok&quot; button on the message
5) i3 stack (mouse is moving, but it doesn't react on keys)
6) switch to console Ctrl-Alt-F2
7) sending message ( i3-msg 2)
8) switch back to X Alt-F7




9) see black window with the mouse cursor

Hi Alexander,



Excerpts from Alexander Kalentyev's message of 2010-04-02 20:32:27 +0200:

&gt;<i> After start I see first tag, mouse is moving although I can't do anything.
</I>
&gt;<i> It just doesn't react on keys. I even couldn't kill it.
</I>
&gt;<i> As I started in a verbose mode I have logs (see attach).
</I>
&gt;<i> I guess I'm doing something wrong, but don't know what...
</I>
Please enable the IPC interface (if not already done) and use the following

command (issue it on a Console or using SSH from a different computer):



 &#160;i3-msg 2



You should see i3 switching to the second workspace now. Now try clicking

on the &quot;1&quot; in the workspace bar. It should switch back now.



If this is the case, there is something wrong with your keybindings or

keyboard or something like that&#8230;



Best regards,

Michael
