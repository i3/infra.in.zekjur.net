<PRE>Hi,

I upgraded to 4.8 from 4.7.2 over the weekend and I've found a small problem
with XFCE Notifications.

If they are configured to start from the top-left or top-right the first one
opens in the center rather than at the top-left or top-right as expected. If
additional notifications are opened after the first one they display as normal,
and if you configure it to open from the bottom-left or bottom-right it works
as normal as well.

Assuming you've got XFCE 4 installed you can see an example by running
xfce4-notifyd-config and using the Preview button with a different config
options.

Note that it did work with 4.7.2, though I had had to override some settings
for windows of the XFCE4 class, essentially &quot;for_window [class=&quot;Xfce4-notifyd&quot;]
floating enable; border none; focus mode_toggle&quot;, but trying each of those
options individually doesn't help, and as a group they actually cause another
problem (the &quot;border none&quot; applies to the focused window, not the notification).

Anyone know what might be causing this? Or want more details?

Thanks,
--
