<PRE>This theme came up again today, so I thought it might be worth hearing 
what others thought about it. I've been with i3wm for about 6 months now, 
and I am extremely happy about not just i3wm, but the tiling paradigm in 
general. This was the first such wm for me. Why it took so long to get 
here, I don't know. I would like to thank the complete implosion into 
darkness that has taken place in the world of &quot;traditional, non-tiling 
desktop computing&quot; for helping me to find what was lost to start with.

Anyway, as a developer, I more and more look at i3/tiling wm as a 
continuation of the &quot;operating system is the ide&quot; paradigm lost to much 
of the non-*nix world. This same narrative of course applies to many work 
flows. The observation I'm blabbing about now is that so many 
applications leverage in-application tiling as a UI paradigm, yet 
ironically would actually be better of being (or at least supporting) 
multi-window UIs so as to keep uniform tiling semantics across all 
running applications. 

I used to say that the most important reason to support multi-window was 
to support multi-head displays. That is still true, but consistent-tiling 
is even a bigger one. Plus of course, when you are on a system with a 
small screen, you would rather cycle through all of an application's 
internal tiles as full screen windows. This is further irony since a 
unified strategy for supporting small and large screen environments was 
one of the core reasons for the aforementioned &quot;great desktop environment 
meltdown&quot; of the early 2010s. 

So really, good work. It's just so different to be getting happier about 
something in computing (especially ui related) than more disgusted. Now, 
I just need to wait another 8-15 years for everyone else to realize the 
&quot;browser is the epicenter of the universe&quot; model has long since jumped 
the shark.
