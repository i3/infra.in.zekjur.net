I actually wrote the patch on master and then rebased (and tested) on
next afterwards. I didn't notice that WM_CLASS was there in next
though, brilliant! I also saw the replies on the pr, and that's what I
get for not checking next ;). One thing it does not have though is an
event for windows that doesn't get focus. However I'm a bit uncertain
about how to add that cleanly, since the event is now pushed in a very
different location.

I could of course add it directly from the &quot;Request to focus con on a
hidden workspace&quot; check in handlers.c. It feels a bit bad though since
the other event is sent in a very different place (x.c). Also would an
event called &quot;focus&quot; that has &quot;focused&quot;:False be enough to make sense
api wise?

Alternately I could add some code to start sending events for
con_set_urgency (since focus request that fails now sets an urgency),
but it wouldn't be usable for my use case unless I also add a reason
for the urgency change. Which I guess could be
demands_attention/focus_request and wm_hints? Not sure about that last
one, where it's really coming from ;).

</I>
It's an issue with glx, I've got an nvidia optimus setup, so I'm not
terribly surprised. I could probably get it working fine by not
loading glx, but it was easier to setup a VM for it. (I should point
out it fails starting the X session, so it's not the test running part
that's broken).
