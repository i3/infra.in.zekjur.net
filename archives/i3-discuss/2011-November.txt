Subject: [i3] Java focus problem
Message-ID: <1320325388-sup-6613@asch>

Hi,

I have problem with java applications in i3 4.0.2. When I run java app,
everything is ok, but when I switch to another window and return back to
java app I can't write text into it. I tried tricks like change wmname
or use openjdk with nonreparenting wm setting. Nothing helps. Is there
chance to run java app with i3 properly?

Hi Brian,

Excerpts from Brian Grossman's message of 2011-11-10 19:50:02 +0000:
> Is build.i3wm.org down on purpose?
No. Until it?s back up again you can use buildbot.i3wm.org (same URL). Be aware
that you might need to explicitly use apt-get install i3 i3-wm since the
version is "lower" than on build.i3wm.org. We plan to fix this once 4.1 is
released.

Best regards,
Michael

Quote from the release notes:

i3 now supports startup notifications, meaning that during an application
starts up, the mouse cursor will change to 'watch' on the root window. Also,
the application window will appear on the workspace on which it was launched
(not on the currently focused workspace). Some applications don?t support
startup notifications. If the cursor change bothers you, turn it off by using
the --no-startup-id flag (see the userguide).

Hi Michael.

That has sorted the i-bar position thank you. I have looked
at the docs and config file and just cannot see where to insert the no
startup flag. I have tried a few places but just get the config error
each time, a bit more help would be welcome.

Thanks

Well, depends on what your config looks like. My guess is that you have some
exec or exec_always lines in your config which are executed on startup:

    exec ~/.bin/my_script.sh

If the applications you start do not support startup notifications (commandline
apps do not), use:

    exec --no-startup-id ~/.bin/my_script.sh

This is documented here:
http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#_automatically_starting_applications_on_i3_startup

If you still have trouble with that, please attach your configfile and the
modified configfile which leads to errors.

Michael

Michael, 

I am probably missing something but why does 13 need startup
notifications. 

Thank you for your help resolving my previous issue with
this new feature but I now see the default terminal is called
"i3-sensible-terminal" which for me starts Konsole, I can change this
to xterm but the "watch" symbol returns when the terminal is closed,
Using the "no-startup-id" again resolves this but for a wm where I
suspect terminal use is higher than with other wm .It seems there
needs to be a few workarounds  to accommodate a questionable new
feature.

I quote the release notes:

i3 now supports startup notifications, meaning that during an application
starts up, the mouse cursor will change to 'watch' on the root window. Also,
the application window will appear on the workspace on which it was launched
(not on the currently focused workspace). Some applications don?t support

the --no-startup-id flag (see the userguide).

> Thank you for your help resolving my previous issue with

i3-sensible-terminal is not a terminal. I quote the manpage
i3-sensible-terminal(1):

i3?sensible?terminal is invoked in the i3 default config to start
a terminal. This wrapper script is necessary since there is no
distribution?independent terminal launcher (but for example De?
bian has x?terminal?emulator). Distribution packagers are re?
sponsible for shipping this script in a way which is appropriate
for the distribution.


> to xterm but the "watch" symbol returns when the terminal is closed,
Fix xterm, then. You can use my patch at
http://lists.schmorp.de/pipermail/rxvt-unicode/2011q4/001444.html
for an example on how to do that.

Remember: i3?s target audience are advanced users and developers. Of course I
agree that it?s better to have things just work, but instead of not using
startup notifications by default and never getting sufficient support anywhere,
I?d like to encourage people to write patches for the programs they care. The
result will be working startup notifications for everyone out of the box. If
the minimum amount of suffering (I mean, :%s/exec/exec --no-startup-id/g is
really not that hard) is really too much for your taste, I can?t help you :).

Best regards,
Michael

At the moment, there is no mouse related configuration except for the
floating_modifier setting [1].

The userguide is authoritive. Anything which is not documented in there is
either not (properly) implemented or not yet ready for prime time.

Some configuration for mouse buttons is planned, but not yet done. Mouse
gestures are very unlikely to appear.

Best regards,
Michael

Michael,

i3 is very much to my taste, I love the simplicity, changing the config
is not a problem, I am just asking what is the point of startup
notification on a wm who's target audience are advanced users and
developers, fine in KDE or Gnome.

It is not meant to be a criticism just asking the question.

Thanks

Ian

Hi ian,

> is not a problem, I am just asking what is the point of startup

I thought quoting the release notes is sufficient to answer that question. Let
me first quote again, then elaborate:

i3 now supports startup notifications, meaning that during an application
starts up, the mouse cursor will change to 'watch' on the root window. Also,
the application window will appear on the workspace on which it was launched
(not on the currently focused workspace). Some applications don?t support
startup notifications. If the cursor change bothers you, turn it off by using
the --no-startup-id flag (see the userguide).

This means two things:
1) We solve the following long-standing bug:
   Start something, switch to a different workspace, the window opens on the
   new workspace instead of where you intended it to be.
2) We display a progress indicator. This is important (and especially so when
   using dmenu, our current recommendation, with its poor feedback) to know
   that your computer is actually doing something (starting an application).
   It is one step closer to making the user being in control, not wondering
   what is currently going on. Previously, you just pressed some key and
   *hoped* that a window would show up soon. Progress indication and
   acknowledgement of user input are fundamental things in good user
   interfaces.

Best regards,
Michael

For me, this is the killer app.

Subject: [i3] dzen2 on top of fullscreen windows
Message-ID: <4EC6CE3D.5020705@gmail.com>

Hello!

For my bottom bar I use i3bar for the workspace list and 'conky-cli' (a 
build of conky that outputs text to stdout) piped to dzen2 for some info.

I use the following line (it's a single line but wrapped in this email) 
to call dzen2 in my config. The relevant variables have been defined before.

exec conky-cli -c ~/.i3/dzonky | dzen2 -x $dzen_left -w $dzen_width -y 
$dzen_top -h $dzen_height -ta r -fn "$font" -bg "$bbg" -fg "$bntext"

It looks like the picture http://i.imgur.com/Kxl2j.png

But when I run (for example) mplayer in fullscreen mode, or fullscreen a 
window with i3's fullscreen command, dzen2 appears on top of the window. 
Is there a way to ensure dzen2 is behind fullscreen windows?

Thanks,

This is because i3 only cares about the windows it actually manages. When you
start dzen2 without -dock it is not managed by a window manager (due to setting
override_redirect=1). Fullscreen windows are only set fullscreen in relation to
other managed windows, that?s why.

> Is there a way to ensure dzen2 is behind fullscreen windows?
Not right now. I?ll see if I can change the code so that fullscreen windows are
also raised above *all* X11 windows, not only managed windows.

Michael

If I start dzen2 with -dock, i3 puts it in a weird position (unless 
there's a way to specify dock positions in i3... ).

I once patched old i3 to get docks where I wanted them:

I guess that would make sense in most cases, yeah? I mean fullscreen 
means 'I only want to see this window', at least to me.

Thanks, I merged it.

I did not get this warning when compiling (with gcc 4.6.1). Which
compiler/version are you using? Or did you explicitly enable that warning?

Hello,

I'm really starting to like i3! 

But I'm having an issue using i3status.
I startup i3 using the slim display manager.

I've got the following in my .xinitrc file.

exec i3&
i3status | dzen2 -y 750 -x 100 -bg black -ta r&

No, I'm using gcc 4.6.2 on openSUSE 12.1 and noticed it as I was
packaging i3 up for the distro and my personal use.  I guess that option
is enabled by default in that release.

Try:

i3status | dzen2 -y 750 -x 100 -bg black -ta r&
exec i3

And that goes into your .xsession, not .xinitrc. .xinitrc is for
startx, .xsession is for DMs. Make sure you use the default X session,
not the distribution-specific i3 X session, which wouldn't execute
.xsession.

Another option would be using exec in the i3 config (check the
userguide), then using whatever you want to launch i3.

And please, next time describe exactly *what* isn't working.

Ah, alright. I would have added that flag, but it seems like it is
SuSE-specific? At least I can only find it in the SuSE-changelogs for gcc.

By the way: I would be glad to put a link to SuSE on the downloads page of i3
once your package is done. Which one would be appropriate? Is there something
comparable to packages.debian.org?

Michael

Yes, that?s all really great, but what exactly is the problem?

By the way, using exec together with & defeats its purpose. Also, the last
command of your .xinitrc should use exec (otherwise you?ll end up having a
useless shell process hanging around).

A wild guess is that you are facing issue http://bugs.i3wm.org/569. In that
case, using dzen2?s -dock option is a workaround [1].

Best regards,
Michael

[1] Yes, you need an SVN checkout of dzen2. Why not use i3bar instead? It?s
    great and works out of the box.

I think it's an upstream gcc option flag, especially as SUSE's gcc
developers are all upstream developers :)

Yes, I've submitted it to the "real" portion of the build.opensuse.org
site, I'll send you a link when it gets accepted in a few days.

I think it's not only fullscreen windows that are affected. For example:

Status bar on the bottom. Workspace buttons (on the left) and dzen2 (on 
the right) in it.
One Firefox window in stacking mode. When I want to download something 
then a new window "Save as" pops up. That new window is horizontally 
centered and vertically stretched (height starts almost on top and ends 
on bottom of the screen).

Now the left part of status bar (workspace buttons) is under the "Save 
as" window, but right part (dzen2) is on top of that window. That was 
not the case in 3.x version.

The problem is that in most cases (like firefox, thunderbird) bottom 
right part of the window is where the buttons are displayed (for example 
"Cancel" "Save") so in effect I can't see them because they are covered 
by dzen2 and I have to manually move/resize that window.

Does it make sense or should I send a screenshot? And how can I fix it?

Thank you in advance, Mick

That's strange... For me both 'parts' of the bar are under the window.

I know this doesn't help much but I encountered something similar yesterday.
When running a Java application, after some time, i3 stopped responding to my keyboard actions but my mouse was fine.

Hi all,

I discovered i3 a week ago and now I'm quite happy with it. But I'm
using an OSD daemon (xfce4-notifyd) which pops up sometimes. I was

for_window [class="Xfce4-notifyd"] floating enable; border none

Why does it even create managed windows? The "standard" libnotify thing does
create unmanaged windows which do not change focus.

I had the same problem with xfce4-notifyd.
As a workaround I have the following line in my ~/.i3/config:

for_window [class="^Xfce4-notifyd$"] floating enable; border none; focus mode_toggle

It's not perfect as it changes focus if popup occurs when floating
window is focused. What is more, it steals focus for a short moment,
so when xfce4-notifyd pops up during typing an address
into Midori's address bar, the input is interrupted. :-(

> Why does it even create managed windows? The "standard" libnotify thing does
> create unmanaged windows which do not change focus.

I guess xfce4-notifyd could be changed to resemble notify-daemon's
standard behaviour, but it would not be desired in Xfce desktop,
as xfwm4 can be configured to be a compositing window manager
and it would not be able to apply transparency to xfce4-notifyd's popups.

Managing xfce4-notifyd's windows can be useful ? it allows you
to use your keyboard to press buttons on the popups.

I think having an option to exclude windows from being managed
or from being able to steal focus would be nice.

What do you think?


Best regards.

I may be missing something, but the "standard" libnotify thing you say
seems to refer to [1]. But I see no mention of the window being
managed or not.

I think what Michael was referring to is the original implementation
of libnotify (shipped in libnotify-bin in Debian). By the way,
notify-osd (from Ubuntu, packaged in Debian) also works great. Looks
like a pretty serious bug in xfce4-notifyd to me.

I have thought of this approach, but gave it up due to the exact
reason you give.

I suppose the WM hint things could be more complex than expected...
I have captured the results of xprop upon notification-daemon and
xfce4-notifyd and put them in attachments.

Just checked out notify-osd and it feels good (looks better, doesn't
steal focus). I thought it was something with lots of Ayatana
dependencies...
