Thanks. I had not heard of Xembed until now. Not sure how good/robust
it is. B is a Python + Qt based application, so I will investigate
Xembed support for it. Appreciate your response and I did try out your
PoC - seems to work decently, though I would like to avoid Xephyr if
possible.

Cheers.

Hi,

Not sure if this has been asked/answered before. I couldn't find
anything pertinent.

Is there an easy way to make a window sticky - like in FVWM - make it
appear in all workspaces?

Thanks.

So far I've not found the way to do this. Can someone please let me know if this is easy to do.

I am building some automation to be used with i3, with an eye towards remote management of a suite of i3 desktops.

I am using the latest i3 (4.8). I need to make the design decision to use high level tools such as "i3-save-tree", or to build my own "tree parsing/manipulation tools".

I would like to understand how stable the tree structure is. If its relatively stable, then I think its pretty safe to build my own tools that work with the i3 tree. Future changes to the tree would be something that I can work with in this case. However if the tree is expected to change a lot then perhaps I don’t want to build my own tools that work with the tree structure.

In a sense I am wondering if I should treat the tree structure (and specification) as a "public" or a "private" spec. Certainly for a given i3 release I can treat it as public, but I don’t want to create automation that will become obsolete with future releases of i3. 

Id appreciate any thoughts or recommendations.

Michael,
Thank you for the suggestion relative to using "focus parent"

As you see in the following output, I certainly can focus parent (to an extent), yet after a couple calls to focus parent I see an odd error. Furthermore this error does not always occur when I have arrived at the workspace level. I could be at a parent container that is within the workspace.

ubuntu at example:~$ DISPLAY=:0.0 i3-msg focus parent
[{"success":true}]
ubuntu at example:~$ DISPLAY=:0.0 i3-msg focus parent
ERROR: Your command: (null)
ERROR:               (null)
ERROR: (null)
[{"success":false}]


I'm trying to figure out when I "arrive at the workspace level". Keep in mind that I am running this script without actually having the visual feedback of the desktop to tell me that I am at the workspace level.

It would be much easier if I could focus the workspace by name (this does not seem to be an option): 
                i3-msg focus workspace 2

What is the proper way for me to script "focus the parent till you arrive at a containing workspace"?

Thanks.

What exactly are you trying to accomplish? Under what circumstances would this
really be necessary? This sounds like the king of all corner cases to me. i3 is
a graphical interface; I can't imagine why you'd need to kill every window on an
i3 workspace if you're essentially trying to run a remote headless system.

Actually with further experimentation, I think that the "funny error" always occurs when I have arrived at a containing workspace.

Assuming that this is true, then it should then be easy for me to simply check for the first failure to focus a parent.


Is there a way to query i3 for the currently focused object? If so then that would be a further check that I can make to ensure that the object with focus is of type "workspace".

The weird error message is a bug, so please report it as such at
http://bugs.i3wm.org/

The layout tree contains “focused” properties, and you can also
manually look at the “focus” array to determine which container is
focused.

Subject: [i3] i3 layout save/restore
Message-ID: <85EA6F68AC24DA48B220EBEA7A8C08B81B506D74@corpmail01.corp.sensis.com>

I am trying to generate my own layout files in python (similar to the files generated by i3-save-tree). I am looking for something that describes the layout specification [above and beyond the i3-save-tree code, which is a bit cryptic for a non-perl expert].

I am already able to get the i3 tree in python. Furthermore I already have a number of operations that I perform on that tree. For example I have an operation that generates an image (representing the workspace structure) for each workspace in the tree. I am at a point where I need to generate layout specs, so that I can subsequently append these to workspaces.

The first couple of specs that I generated are essentially just a dump of the portion of the portion of the tree that corresponds to the workspace. I know these need to be tweaked further. For example I have not yet added "swallows", nor stripped non-necessary elements (like "fullscreen_mode" or "layout"). However I thought that i3 would allow me to load these specs and then I could begin to trim them and modify them until they looked more like the specs generated by i3-save-tree. Indeed I hoped that i3 might provide feedback relative to the elements of the spec that were not right.

The unfortunate thing is that i3 crashes when it attempts to load my specs. So rather than move from the form that I have incrementally towards the "right form", I need to jump to the right form more quickly.

A specification for the layout structure would help. Is there anything that exists above and beyond the perl code, and the samples of generated layouts that I can create with it?

For example, here is the portion of the tree that corresponds to the workspace that I am trying to save a spec for: this particular simple workspace is one window on top of another.  Other than the obvious things like adding a proper swallows element, what are the key things that I need to keep in mind when transforming portions of the i3 tree into a form that can later be appended?

{"fullscreen_mode": 1, "orientation": "horizontal", "focus": [23160000, 23125184], "urgent": false, "num": 1, "last_split_layout": "splith", "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal", "id": 23119648, "current_border_width": -1, "layout": "splith", "percent": null, "workspace_layout": "default", "window": null, "nodes": [{"window_properties": {"instance": "xterm", "class": "XTerm", "title": "ubuntu at example-8930: ~/playground/cwpmash"}, "fullscreen_mode": 0, "orientation": "none", "focus": [], "urgent": false, "last_split_layout": "splith", "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal", "id": 23125184, "current_border_width": -1, "layout": "splith", "percent": 0.5, "workspace_layout": "default", "window": 25165860, "nodes": [], "type": "con", "swallows": [], "focused": false, "scratchpad_state": "none", "rect": {"y": 18, "x": 0, "height": 1013, "width": 840}, "window_rect": {"y": 0, "x": 2, "height": 1009, "width": 834}, "name": "ubuntu at example-8930: ~/playground/cwpmash", "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484}, "floating_nodes": []}, {"window_properties": {"instance": "xterm", "class": "XTerm", "title": "ubuntu at example-8930: ~"}, "fullscreen_mode": 0, "orientation": "none", "focus": [], "urgent": false, "last_split_layout": "splith", "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal", "id": 23160000, "current_border_width": -1, "layout": "splith", "percent": 0.5, "workspace_layout": "default", "window": 27263012, "nodes": [], "type": "con", "swallows": [], "focused": true, "scratchpad_state": "none", "rect": {"y": 18, "x": 840, "height": 1013, "width": 840}, "window_rect": {"y": 0, "x": 2, "height": 1009, "width": 834}, "name": "ubuntu at example-8930: ~", "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484}, "floating_nodes": []}], "type": "workspace", "swallows": [], "focused": false, "scratchpad_state": "none", "rect": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 1031, "width": 1680}, "window_rect": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 0, "width": 0}, "name": "1", "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 0, "width": 0}, "floating_nodes": []}

The correct form (as generated by i3-save-tree) is:

// vim:ts=4:sw=4:et

    "border": "normal",
    "floating": "auto_off",
    "geometry": {

I've made a little progress with this generation of a json layout spec. Note that I am trying to be completely json compliant. So, unlike the i3-save-tree (which saves multiple json documents), I have a json spec that only has one json document. My reading of the i3 documentation seems to suggest that i3 has no problem with this, and it seems that it doesn't have a problem.

In the sample that I provided below I have reduced the spec to the following form:

{"fullscreen_mode": 1, "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal", "layout": "splith", "percent": null, "nodes": [{"window_properties": {"title": "yo"}, "fullscreen_mode": 0, "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal", "layout": "splith", "percent": 0.5,  "nodes": [], "type": "con", "swallows": [{"class": "^XTerm$"}], "name": "ubuntu at example-8930: ~", "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484}}, {"window_properties": {"title": "go"}, "fullscreen_mode": 0, "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal",  "layout": "splith", "percent": 0.5, "nodes": [], "type": "con", "swallows": [{"class": "^XTerm$"}], "name": "ubuntu at example-8930: ~", "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484}}], "type": "workspace", "swallows": []}

Notice that this spec actually has 3 swallows one for the parent workspace and two for the 2 xterm leaf nodes. Not sure why this is, but it is what I received when I requested the tree. I3-save-tree (I think) only shows a swallows for leaf nodes.

I can actually append this document to a workspace (i3-msg "workspace 2; append_layout /home/ubuntu/.i3/layout_spec") - i3 does not crash on this spec.

However I see two problems:
1] The spec actually overlays the workspace (rather than appending to it)
2] The windows do not swallow a subsequent xterm.

Why does this spec result in an "overlay" rather than an "append"?  Why is my swallow not working?

Ok. I have made even further headway with this. Let me summarize what I think I have learned:

1] By removing the window_properties from the spec I was able to get the "swallows" to work properly
2] By only including the leaf nodes I was able to append, rather than overlay. 

So it would seem that i3 has the ability to not only append a layout but to overlay a layout (onto an existing workspace). This almost seems like a feature. Though I am not sure what unintended consequences there might be.

The latter can be seen in two examples:
The following spec does an append:

{
        "window_properties": {"title": "mo"},
        "fullscreen_mode": 0,
        "floating": "auto_off",
        "border": "normal",
        "layout": "splith",
        "percent": 0.5,
        "nodes": [],
        "type": "con",
        "swallows": [
                    {
                    "class": "^XTerm$"
                    }
        ],
        "name": "one",
        "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484}
}

{
        "fullscreen_mode": 0,
        "floating": "auto_off",
        "border": "normal",
        "layout": "splith",
        "percent": 0.5,
        "nodes": [],
        "type": "con",
        "swallows": [
                {
                "class": "^XTerm$"
                }
        ],
        "name": "two",
        "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484}
}

Whereas by keeping the parent workspace we end up with an overlay:

{
"fullscreen_mode": 1,
"floating": "auto_off",
 "border": "normal",
"layout": "splith",
"percent": null,
 "nodes": [
          {
         "fullscreen_mode": 0,
         "floating": "auto_off",
         "border": "normal",

I am trying to generate my own layout files in python (similar to the files generated by i3-save-tree). I am looking for something that describes the layout specification [above and beyond the i3-save-tree code, which is a bit cryptic for a non-perl expert].

I am already able to get the i3 tree in python. Furthermore I already have a number of operations that I perform on that tree. For example I have an operation that generates an image (representing the workspace structure) for each workspace in the tree. I am at a point where I need to generate layout specs, so that I can subsequently append these to workspaces.

The first couple of specs that I generated are essentially just a dump of the portion of the portion of the tree that corresponds to the workspace. I know these need to be tweaked further. For example I have not yet added "swallows", nor stripped non-necessary elements (like "fullscreen_mode" or "layout"). However I thought that i3 would allow me to load these specs and then I could begin to trim them and modify them until they looked more like the specs generated by i3-save-tree. Indeed I hoped that i3 might provide feedback relative to the elements of the spec that were not right.

The unfortunate thing is that i3 crashes when it attempts to load my specs. So rather than move from the form that I have incrementally towards the "right form", I need to jump to the right form more quickly.

A specification for the layout structure would help. Is there anything that exists above and beyond the perl code, and the samples of generated layouts that I can create with it?

For example, here is the portion of the tree that corresponds to the workspace that I am trying to save a spec for: this particular simple workspace is one window on top of another.  Other than the obvious things like adding a proper swallows element, what are the key things that I need to keep in mind when transforming portions of the i3 tree into a form that can later be appended?

I've made a little progress with this generation of a json layout spec. Note that I am trying to be completely json compliant. So, unlike the i3-save-tree (which saves multiple json documents), I have a json spec that only has one json document. My reading of the i3 documentation seems to suggest that i3 has no problem with this, and it seems that it doesn't have a problem.

In the sample that I provided below I have reduced the spec to the following form:

{"fullscreen_mode": 1, "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal", "layout": "splith", "percent": null, "nodes": [{"window_properties": {"title": "yo"}, "fullscreen_mode": 0, "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal", "layout": "splith", "percent": 0.5,  "nodes": [], "type": "con", "swallows": [{"class": "^XTerm$"}], "name": "ubuntu at example-8930: ~", "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484}}, {"window_properties": {"title": "go"}, "fullscreen_mode": 0, "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal",  "layout": "splith", "percent": 0.5, "nodes": [], "type": "con", "swallows": [{"class": "^XTerm$"}], "name": "ubuntu at example-8930: ~", "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484}}], "type": "workspace", "swallows": []}

Notice that this spec actually has 3 swallows one for the parent workspace and two for the 2 xterm leaf nodes. Not sure why this is, but it is what I received when I requested the tree. I3-save-tree (I think) only shows a swallows for leaf nodes.

I can actually append this document to a workspace (i3-msg "workspace 2; append_layout /home/ubuntu/.i3/layout_spec") - i3 does not crash on this spec.

However I see two problems:
1] The spec actually overlays the workspace (rather than appending to it) 2] The windows do not swallow a subsequent xterm.

Why does this spec result in an "overlay" rather than an "append"?  Why is my swallow not working?

I almost have this working. 

Can someone please explain to me what the following code snippet (drawn from i3-save-tree) does:


    for my $key (qw(nodes floating_nodes)) {
        $tree->{$key} = [ map { strip_containers($_) } @{$tree->{$key}} ];
    }

I think this is making a recursive call to strip_containers, for containers that container either "nodes" or "floating_nodes".

I don’t see the code that actually deletes "empty nodes" and empty "floating_nodes". Perhaps this code does that as well through the creation of a new map that contains just the allowed_keys..

Ok. I have made even further headway with this. Let me summarize what I think I have learned:

1] By removing the window_properties from the spec I was able to get the "swallows" to work properly 2] By only including the leaf nodes I was able to append, rather than overlay. 

So it would seem that i3 has the ability to not only append a layout but to overlay a layout (onto an existing workspace). This almost seems like a feature. Though I am not sure what unintended consequences there might be.

The latter can be seen in two examples:
The following spec does an append:

{
        "window_properties": {"title": "mo"},
        "fullscreen_mode": 0,
        "floating": "auto_off",
        "border": "normal",
        "layout": "splith",
        "percent": 0.5,
        "nodes": [],
        "type": "con",
        "swallows": [
                    {
                    "class": "^XTerm$"
                    }
        ],
        "name": "one",
        "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484} }

{
        "fullscreen_mode": 0,
        "floating": "auto_off",
        "border": "normal",
        "layout": "splith",
        "percent": 0.5,
        "nodes": [],
        "type": "con",
        "swallows": [
                {
                "class": "^XTerm$"
                }
        ],
        "name": "two",
        "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484} }

Whereas by keeping the parent workspace we end up with an overlay:

{
"fullscreen_mode": 1,
"floating": "auto_off",
 "border": "normal",
"layout": "splith",
"percent": null,
 "nodes": [
          {
         "fullscreen_mode": 0,
         "floating": "auto_off",
         "border": "normal",
         "layout": "splith",
         "percent": 0.5,
         "nodes": [],
         "type": "con",
         "swallows": [{"class": "^XTerm$"}],
         "name": "one",
         "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484}},
         {
         "fullscreen_mode": 0,

I am trying to generate my own layout files in python (similar to the files generated by i3-save-tree). I am looking for something that describes the layout specification [above and beyond the i3-save-tree code, which is a bit cryptic for a non-perl expert].

I am already able to get the i3 tree in python. Furthermore I already have a number of operations that I perform on that tree. For example I have an operation that generates an image (representing the workspace structure) for each workspace in the tree. I am at a point where I need to generate layout specs, so that I can subsequently append these to workspaces.

The first couple of specs that I generated are essentially just a dump of the portion of the portion of the tree that corresponds to the workspace. I know these need to be tweaked further. For example I have not yet added "swallows", nor stripped non-necessary elements (like "fullscreen_mode" or "layout"). However I thought that i3 would allow me to load these specs and then I could begin to trim them and modify them until they looked more like the specs generated by i3-save-tree. Indeed I hoped that i3 might provide feedback relative to the elements of the spec that were not right.

The unfortunate thing is that i3 crashes when it attempts to load my specs. So rather than move from the form that I have incrementally towards the "right form", I need to jump to the right form more quickly.

A specification for the layout structure would help. Is there anything that exists above and beyond the perl code, and the samples of generated layouts that I can create with it?

For example, here is the portion of the tree that corresponds to the workspace that I am trying to save a spec for: this particular simple workspace is one window on top of another.  Other than the obvious things like adding a proper swallows element, what are the key things that I need to keep in mind when transforming portions of the i3 tree into a form that can later be appended?

I've made a little progress with this generation of a json layout spec. Note that I am trying to be completely json compliant. So, unlike the i3-save-tree (which saves multiple json documents), I have a json spec that only has one json document. My reading of the i3 documentation seems to suggest that i3 has no problem with this, and it seems that it doesn't have a problem.

In the sample that I provided below I have reduced the spec to the following form:

{"fullscreen_mode": 1, "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal", "layout": "splith", "percent": null, "nodes": [{"window_properties": {"title": "yo"}, "fullscreen_mode": 0, "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal", "layout": "splith", "percent": 0.5,  "nodes": [], "type": "con", "swallows": [{"class": "^XTerm$"}], "name": "ubuntu at example-8930: ~", "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484}}, {"window_properties": {"title": "go"}, "fullscreen_mode": 0, "floating": "auto_off", "border": "normal",  "layout": "splith", "percent": 0.5, "nodes": [], "type": "con", "swallows": [{"class": "^XTerm$"}], "name": "ubuntu at example-8930: ~", "geometry": {"y": 0, "x": 0, "height": 316, "width": 484}}], "type": "workspace", "swallows": []}

Notice that this spec actually has 3 swallows one for the parent workspace and two for the 2 xterm leaf nodes. Not sure why this is, but it is what I received when I requested the tree. I3-save-tree (I think) only shows a swallows for leaf nodes.

I can actually append this document to a workspace (i3-msg "workspace 2; append_layout /home/ubuntu/.i3/layout_spec") - i3 does not crash on this spec.

However I see two problems:
1] The spec actually overlays the workspace (rather than appending to it) 2] The windows do not swallow a subsequent xterm.

Why does this spec result in an "overlay" rather than an "append"?  Why is my swallow not working?

I've found a bug with the i3 save/restore mechanism

In general the save/load works fine (I've tried a number of layouts that work fine), however I have found a simple configuration that fails to save/load correctly. I'm not sure yet if this is a problem with i3, or with i3-save-tree.

I opened three windows in a workspace (and then saved using i3-save-tree --workspace test > /home/ubuntu/.i3/spec)
2 xterms side-by-side in top row
1 emacs in bottom row (I used the mod-shift-k to move emacs down)


Correct Layout (the layout I saved with i3-save-tree)

Ok. I've dug further, and am sure that this is a problem with i3-save-tree.

The containing workspace (container type = "workspace") has some critical information that is stripped away by i3-save-tree. Specifically the workspace container structure (including the "splitv layout") is lost as part of the pruning process.

I can provide the entire "tree" associated with the workspace if that would help. But I think perhaps I've given enough detail to understand the issue. 

Please let me know if I should provide additional diagnostics.

Subject: i3 save/restore bug

I've found a bug with the i3 save/restore mechanism

In general the save/load works fine (I've tried a number of layouts that work fine), however I have found a simple configuration that fails to save/load correctly. I'm not sure yet if this is a problem with i3, or with i3-save-tree.

I opened three windows in a workspace (and then saved using i3-save-tree --workspace test > /home/ubuntu/.i3/spec)
2 xterms side-by-side in top row
1 emacs in bottom row (I used the mod-shift-k to move emacs down)


Correct Layout (the layout I saved with i3-save-tree) _________________________________________________

Can you please stop creating new threads for this? This is the fourth
thread on the same topic that I have in my Inbox right now.

Also, it seems like your questions are better suited for a live medium
like IRC. Or just sleep over what you have and ask the next day, since
you seem to frequently figure it out after posting to the list.

It is replacing “nodes” and “floating_nodes” with the result of
calling strip_containers() on each of the elements of “nodes” and
“floating_nodes”.

However I thought that i3 would allow me to load these specs and then I could begin to trim them and modify them until they looked more like the specs generated by i3-save-tree.

> I've made a little progress with this generation of a json layout spec. Note that I am trying to be completely json compliant. So, unlike the i3-save-tree (which saves multiple json documents), I have a json spec that only has one json document. My reading of the i3 documentation seems to suggest that i3 has no problem with this, and it seems that it doesn't have a problem.

> Notice that this spec actually has 3 swallows one for the parent workspace and two for the 2 xterm leaf nodes. Not sure why this is, but it is what I received when I requested the tree. I3-save-tree (I think) only shows a swallows for leaf nodes.

For example I have an operation that generates an image (representing the workspace structure) for each workspace in the tree. I am at a point where I need to generate layout specs, so that I can subsequently append these to workspaces.
>
> The first couple of specs that I generated are essentially just a dump of the portion of the portion of the tree that corresponds to the workspace. I know these need to be tweaked further. For example I have not yet added "swallows", nor stripped non-necessary elements (like "fullscreen_mode" or "layout"). However I thought that i3 would allow me to load these specs and then I could begin to trim them and modify them until they looked more like the specs generated by i3-save-tree. Indeed I hoped that i3 might provide feedback relative to the elements of the spec that were not right.
>
> The unfortunate thing is that i3 crashes when it attempts to load my specs. So rather than move from the form that I have incrementally towards the "right form", I need to jump to the right form more quickly.

Subject: [i3] Re-tiling a bunch of windows?
Message-ID: <5419BE46.2000203@jafo.ca>

A few months ago I came back to I3 after having tried a few other things (KDE
again, tried Awesome).  But in the end I just really kept wanting to come back
to I3.

However, one thing that Awesome had that I'm really missing from I3 is an
ability to re-tile a bunch of windows.  In particular, I often run "cssh"
which opens 15 to 30 windows, and I'm manually going in and moving them left
or right to get them into a 3 or 4 different columns.  It sure would be nice
if there was a way to say "Reflow all my windows into 4 columns, evenly".

With Awesome it is more of a stack, and you have the "primary" window, so it
is easy enough to move things up and down that stack, so it isn't a big deal
how it orders the windows.  But in this case, I really don't care how it
orders them.

I will admit that I kind of missed the "primary window" idea and the ability
to swap things with the primary window.  But mostly what I'm doing right now
is to either "full screen" the window I want to focus on, or I switch the
container layout so that it becomes full height -- which means I lose other
windows in that stack, but I still have other stacks I can use for viewing on
the screen while in my "primary" window.

Anyway, I'm wondering what the right approach would be to get this re-flowing
to happen.  Would it be something internal to i3, where maybe there are a few
layouts you could choose from?  Or is this doable from an external script?  I
haven't done any i3 external scripting before.

Thanks,
Sean

So I guess you've heard about layout saving and restoring?

Lay out your windows the way you like (4 columns) manually, then save
the layout. Then next time you want to open cssh, restore the layout
just before you start cssh. Would that work for you?

There's also the IPC interface adding scriptability to i3, which could
do the trick and automatically lay out selected windows into a grid or
something like that. Not automagically like with a real WM-based layout,
but that's as close as you can get with i3, I guess.

I hadn't, I guess it is pretty recent?  Looks like I'll have to grab the
Ubuntu 14.10 package, which is 4.8, and build it on my 14.04 system, but
that should be doable.  I'll have to give that a shot, but it looks like it
might work for this.

Thanks,

Subject: [i3] i3-nagbar and keyboard
Message-ID: <541E07F8.6010104@mehrzweckraum.com>

hi..

i found this a rather strange anachronism that the nagbar cant be 
navigated with the keyboard. or am i missing something here?

is there a full HID support for i3-nagbar planned at some point?


just for reference:
since i am building a very simplified X11 enviroment only to be run 
occassionaly on top of a more or less automated headless box on simple 
hardware like raspberry pi or banana pi or similar: yes, i need and want 
to exit i3 without shutting down the box. also i want to get by with the 
least amount of extra tools.

i have found an answer to what i am trying to do here:
https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1262/exiting-i3-without-mouse-click/

but dmenu doesn't support mouse navigation, doh.

so i ended up writing a quick python script with a tk yes/no box for this.

still, the anachronism stands: having a WM with full keyboard support, 
except for the nagbar.

cheers,
grubernd

The nagbar should _nag_ you, and obviously it accomplishes its
mission, since you are annoyed enough to write to this mailing list
:). Read: this is intentional.

ok. well.

let's put the - imo quite obvious - use of the nagbar for an exit dialog 
aside for a moment and consider the more usual case of editing something 
inside the i3 config and making an error. or lo and behold starting i3 
with an error already in the config.

if i read that right, it is the intention to force the user to get away 
from the computer, walk through a convention center, ask everyone if she 
has a mouse to spare. or walk to the parking lot to the car and dig 
through the box of odds and ends to see if a mouse is there. or drive to 
the next electronic market and buy a mouse. or a graphic tablet. not 
everyone has an external thinkpad keyboard with integrated nipple.

all that just to be able to read the error message the fully keyboard 
enabled window manager is showing in a big red bar but wont let one see 
until a pointer-enabled HID is attached to the machine.

to phrase it in a very blunt way:

i consider this rather impolite to force a certain type of HID unto the 
user that is uneccessary in all other cases.

yes, there is a logfile etc, but..

and the above mentioned use case is not made up. i am using computers 
without a mouse. except for the case that i was so awesome that i did 
not make an error and did not have to ask a bunch of windows7 laptop 
users if they had a spare mouse. uh.

back to the exit use-case: i have a solution, no harm done. but maybe, 
just maybe it would be very cool and user-friendly to reconsider the 
intentional behaviour of the nagbar.

because, after all.. it is *the* builtin method into i3 to display 
meta-messages and dialogs inside the window manager. last time i checked 
cursor-keys are still available even on apple-keyboards. and shifting 
focus to the nagbar would be more inline with nagging the user. and more 
so without breaking usability.

just my 2ct.

cheers,
grubernd

It is impolite. It's nagging. The point is that it serves as a negative
incentive toward compulsive behavior (if you make an error message easy to
ignore, people will ignore it). If you don't feel you need that sort of
thing, then just open your config file and remove the one and only place where
the nagbar dialog is. Once you get your config the way you like it you'll never
see i3-nagbar again anyway. ;)

Here you go: `bindsym $mod+Escape pkill i3-nagbar`.

Yes, nobody likes nagbar. But I don't think that there is any reason to 
change it. Nagbar is meant to be a teaching tool for new users. It 
appears when you have a syntax error in your config file or duplicate 
binding. It's there to warn you about the default key combination that 
exits the wm so you don't press it on accident for the first time. If 
your config file is free of errors, you should never see it.

One thing that I don't like about some desktop environments is that they 
are too talky. There is always something flashing in the corner or some 
popup notification that I don't care about on my screen. i3 is designed 
to be quiet. There is no other window manager "meta information" that 
needs to be displayed in nagbar other than config errors. This is good 
unix engineering.

i have a better hack:

and here we have a misunderstanding. i like nagbar, because it would be 
a very elegant way of displaying dialogs inside the window manager 
without resorting to extra tools like dialog, ncurses, gtk, or whatever.

ouch. see engineering below..

i am really glad that the designers of most software dont follow your 
line of thought. imagine all software would display funky big bars that 
*do not follow their own design paradigm* and force you to use a 
differnt interface than they usually do.

yes, and that's a good thing. i dont want i3 to talk more. but here's 
the thing: i3 already has a method to display user-initiated system 
dialogs, aka "the nagbar", but they do not follow the general design 
paradigm of keyboard-centered control. and that is the thing i am trying 
to get across. i3 doesnt follow it's own rules.

i dont know too much about good _unix_ engineering, but good engineering 
doesnt get in the way of the user and changes behaviour midway.

mind: nagbar should nag. but in my opinion it should not be the only 
tool that requires a very specific type of hardware to be attached to 
the computer. that's all i am saying.

It doesn’t require a mouse. You can just kill it. Or fix the error in
your config file and run “i3 reload”. Or (for the use case of exiting
your session) run “i3 exit”, or just shut down your computer, or
terminate the X session otherwise.

There are plenty of alternatives, but they are not as convenient as
just using nagbar when having a mouse attached. Similarly, i3 comes
with a resize mode configured by default (keyboard shortcuts), yet
resizing with a mouse is typically more convenient.

i3’s line of thinking doesn’t dictate the keyboard as the one and only
input device in all situations. We encourage you to use whichever
input device is the most appropriate. For most window management
operations, that’s clearly the keyboard, for resizing that’s most
often the mouse, for nagging users that’s clearly the mouse :).

Also note that nagbar is _not_ a generic tool to display dialogs that
is well integrated into i3. Its purpose really is to nag you about
config errors (so that you don’t nag us in our support channels) and
before exiting a session accidentally. For the latter, you are
expected to eventually change your config to bypass nagbar entirely.

I don’t want to shut you up, but after this reply I don’t think
there’s a lot to talk about anymore. I get that you don’t like the
situation as-is, but the nagbar concept works very well for all other
users that I’ve talked to, and it is very unlikely to change.

i3-msg "move workspace 6 to output DVI-I-3"

I am trying to move a named workspace to a named output. The command above does not seem to work. Rather it moves the current window to a new workspace with the name "6 to output DVI-I-3"

How can I achieve this?

I have written my own python script to append a workspace layout to a workspace. As part of this it also creates the workspace on the fly. The script will automatically append a layout to a named workspace and launch applications that will get "swallowed" by that workspace upon launch.

It works fine, except for one small detail. Once the applications get swallowed everything looks fine. I see the applications in their proper layout and I see the toolbar that shows the workspaces (including the newly created one). However as soon as I move the cursor the toolbar disappears (the layout expands to cover it). If I kill the applications in that workspace then the toolbar becomes visible again.

The layout file is generated by another python script that I created. It mimics i3-save-tree (except that it does not have the i3-save-tree bug that I mentioned previously).

I'm sure that I'm doing something slightly wrong with the layout file creation. Yet as I said this mechanism is almost working perfectly. W

What would cause the toolbar to auto-hide?

Use cardinal directions instead of the output name.[1]

I've also tried this:

i3-msg workspace 5 output DVI-I-3

The following section of the users guide says that should work. However this just creates a new workspace with the name "5 output DVI-I-3"

I just got my system updated to the latest i3, and rebooted to get this and
other updates active.  It works quite well for this need, thanks!

No — section 4 is about configuration, not about commands that you can
send at runtime.

If you can reproduce this, file a bugreport with the layout file
you’re using at http://bugs.i3wm.org/

i3bar is placed in a dock container, perhaps in your situation the
container type is not properly set up…

Subject: [i3] Some workspaces not showing when undocked
Message-ID: <1411895558.184677.172571309.555D0E61@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hi.



I'm using a laptop, which is connected to two other screens
when docked. I have assigned the workspaces to the following
screens:

# eDP1 = laptop

# DP2 & DP1 = external screens.

workspace 1 output DP2

workspace 2 output DP2

workspace 3 output DP2

workspace 4 output DP1

workspace 5 output DP1

workspace 6 output DP1

workspace 7 output eDP1



When undocking I run the following randr command to switch off
the other screens:

$xrandr --output VIRTUAL1 --off --output eDP1 --mode 1920x1080
--pos 0x0 --rotate normal --output DP1 --off --output ↪HDMI2
--off --output HDMI1 --off --output DP2 --off



However I often experience that I'm unable to go to other
workspaces than 1 & 7 when undocked. Sometimes 2-6 works, but
it seems to be working quite randomly. It doesn't help either
if I log out and in again.



When searching for people having the same issue it seems that
i3 should be handling this scenario without issues, so I'm sure
there is something I have overlooked.



Any ideas on how to get this working properly?

My guess is that something goes wrong when setting your display
settings on undock.

I’d start by logging a confirmation line to a file in your
undock-script so that you know it gets executed.

Also, I’d check the i3 log, see http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html,
and check whether the randr settings are as you expect them after
undocking.

Instead of logging out and in again, try changing your settings using xrandr.

I've got a layout file that cause i3 (version 4.8) to hang 100% consistently.

I use the i3-msg append_layout command to cause this. I've used it with other layout files just fine.

What is it about this file that causes i3 to hang?

I've included the layout file below:

My guess is that something goes wrong when setting your display settings on undock.

I’d start by logging a confirmation line to a file in your undock-script so that you know it gets executed.

Also, I’d check the i3 log, see http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html,
and check whether the randr settings are as you expect them after undocking.

Instead of logging out and in again, try changing your settings using xrandr.

Looking more closely. Its clear that the "floating_nodes"  portion of my layout is incorrect. Will fix by converting window_properties to swallows.

Subject: layout file causes i3 to hang

I've got a layout file that cause i3 (version 4.8) to hang 100% consistently.

I use the i3-msg append_layout command to cause this. I've used it with other layout files just fine.

What is it about this file that causes i3 to hang?

I've included the layout file below:

    "floating": "auto_off", 
    "floating_nodes": [

My guess is that something goes wrong when setting your display settings on undock.

I’d start by logging a confirmation line to a file in your undock-script so that you know it gets executed.

Also, I’d check the i3 log, see http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html,
and check whether the randr settings are as you expect them after undocking.

Instead of logging out and in again, try changing your settings using xrandr.

I3 swallows the following just fine
"class": "^Firefox$"

But it wont swallow title as follows (notice in this case I don’t use anchors since I want to match any title containing YouTube):
"title": "YouTube"

I run firefox as follows
firefox -no-remote http://youtube.com


I've done other experiments with the "title" swallow spec, but I don’t have any luck getting i3 to swallow the title.

The complete swallows spec that I'm using is:
            "swallows": [
                {"title": "YouTube"}
            ],

                {"title": "YouTube"}
            ],

Hi Dave, 


Heuristic number one: If you have an issue with i3, and flash is
involved, it is not an issue with i3. Can you show the problem with
i3-sensible-terminal (specify which)? 

Also, judging from your email address and disclaimer, you are probably
building some multimonitor drone control high precision WMD kill
interface. Just for your information, i3 is really not suited for
that. dwm is really more oriented towards those type of purposes. 

Cheers, 

Joep

Joep,

Thanks for your response.

Relative to your thought about flash...
    I am not using flash not sure how you came up with that. I am using i3 4.8 and trying to get it to swallow a firefox with a title spec. Having dug more, I do think that this may be an issue with firefox (rather than i3). I've tried the same with chromium-browser with greater success.

Relative to your second comment "something about a WMD kill interface"... 
    Huh?

I3 swallows the following just fine
"class": "^Firefox$"

But it wont swallow title as follows (notice in this case I don’t use anchors since I want to match any title containing YouTube):
"title": "YouTube"

I run firefox as follows
firefox -no-remote http://youtube.com


I've done other experiments with the "title" swallow spec, but I don’t have any luck getting i3 to swallow the title.

The complete swallows spec that I'm using is:
            "swallows": [
                {"title": "YouTube"}
            ],

Subject: i3 does not swallow title correctly

I3 swallows the following just fine
"class": "^Firefox$"

But it wont swallow title as follows (notice in this case I don’t use anchors since I want to match any title containing YouTube):
"title": "YouTube"

I run firefox as follows
firefox -no-remote http://youtube.com


I've done other experiments with the "title" swallow spec, but I don’t have any luck getting i3 to swallow the title.

The complete swallows spec that I'm using is:
            "swallows": [
                {"title": "YouTube"}
            ],

Hi Dave, 


Heuristic number one: If you have an issue with i3, and flash is involved, it is not an issue with i3. Can you show the problem with i3-sensible-terminal (specify which)? 

Also, judging from your email address and disclaimer, you are probably building some multimonitor drone control high precision WMD kill interface. Just for your information, i3 is really not suited for that. dwm is really more oriented towards those type of purposes. 

Cheers, 

Joep

Hi,

you should really look at the i3 logs, as often windows change their
titles and such *after* they are mapped and afaik firefox is a
prime example of this. So the state of the window when you run Xprop is
really no indication as to what you should put in your i3 config (as
this is afaik applied during mapping, as this is the only sane thing to
do).

Best,

Merovius

PS: In the future, could you pretty please attach large logs as files,
instead of pasting them inline?

You're trying to control a Firefox instance titled "YouTube." Assuming Flash was
involved wasn't much of a stretch.

You say you've tried this with Chromium with "greater succcess," which is to say
incomplete success. What exactly are you trying to do? How has using Chromium
gotten you close to that than using Firefox? It's always wise to explain what
your end-goal is when asking someone for what you believe will be the answer.
