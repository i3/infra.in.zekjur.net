<PRE>I'm interested in simple ways to manage sessions / layouts in i3


I'm not looking for any changes to be made to accommodate this sort of
functionality, just some suggestions and clarifications for setting up a
session in an efficient way. Strategies and best-practices if you like.


My plan is to use startup commands in the config file in conjunction
with a few manual commands to circumvent problems with timing etc. This
means it isn't totally automatic, but I don't need that for the number
of times I typically restart or reboot.



So my plan is:


1) As part of the config file, create and name workspaces, and split,
arrange and attach clients to them. The clients in general will be the
lowest resource client I can find, likely an xterm or similar.

This should give me a set of empty placeholders ready to accept my
&quot;real&quot; client apps.


2) Again as part of my config file, &quot;exec&quot; all of the real applications
I need, leaving them piling up on the first workspace. I'll just sit
back and let them do their stuff so there shouldn't be timing issues


3) When I'm satisfied most stuff has loaded, execute a bindsym'ed
command to shift the clients from their default positions on the first
workspace into the slots I've created for them in step 1 (and zap the
unloved placeholder apps)



I realise that some of this can be automated and examples of this are
given in the documentation, but I couldn't see how I could, for
instance, exec gPodder and Audacious, shift them to their own workspace,
and arrange them split-screen side-by-side as part of the config /
startup process.



Does that seem like a sensible approach? And what gotcha should I look
out for?


As a bonus question, can I chain more than one i3 built-in command to a
single binding, and can I execute i3 commands one after another just by
adding them to the end of the config file?


If it *is* possible to chain more than one command to a binding, how do
I deal with parameters?



Lastly, great work on i3; it's the first tiling manager that has *just*
enough functionality to make abandoning the default on 10.04 pain-free
and more efficient.
