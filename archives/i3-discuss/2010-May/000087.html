<PRE>Hi,

Excerpts from registration.i3's message of 2010-05-08 15:17:45 +0200:
&gt;<i> I realise that some of this can be automated and examples of this are
</I>&gt;<i> given in the documentation, but I couldn't see how I could, for
</I>&gt;<i> instance, exec gPodder and Audacious, shift them to their own workspace,
</I>&gt;<i> and arrange them split-screen side-by-side as part of the config /
</I>&gt;<i> startup process.
</I>Well, you can&#8217;t really do that at the moment. Of course, you can use a
script and the IPC interface to send the same commands you would use
interactively to move these windows, but that&#8217;s not really a good
solution (although I know of at least one user who has a config like this).

&gt;<i> As a bonus question, can I chain more than one i3 built-in command to a
</I>&gt;<i> single binding, and can I execute i3 commands one after another just by
</I>&gt;<i> adding them to the end of the config file?
</I>No you can&#8217;t do either.

&gt;<i> If it *is* possible to chain more than one command to a binding, how do
</I>&gt;<i> I deal with parameters?
</I>What kind of parameters do you mean?

In general, I would recommend you to wait for the next version of i3 (currently
developed in the &quot;tree&quot; branch) which will have a lot of features in this
respect (chaining of commands, matching specific windows with commands,
having pre-defined layouts, session-saving, &#8230;). On the other hand, it may
take quite a while until it&#8217;s ready.

Best regards,
Michael
