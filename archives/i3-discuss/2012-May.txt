Hi,

Cool, but this is rather confusing. First, your commit message is now
"Above commits squashed", which makes no sense at all to someone
reading the i3 history (if the patch gets merged).

Second, it's not a trivial patch. Glancing over it, it looks like it
changes the meaning of some functions, renames some stuff. It's not
clear to me why those changes are being made.

Please describe it better. With Git, we generally use a short
description that really gets to the point. Then we skip a line and
write a detailed description of the commit. Take a lookat the commit
message for e114b3db, which introduces changes that need to be
explained.

If you're changing the IPC protocol, describe how you're changing it.
What exactly is being changed in the protocol? Is the change backwards
compatible? Why do we need it, i.e., what's the use case?

If you're doing this to change the IPC protocol, why are you touching
x.c? How does that change the way i3 works?

Also, if you feel that the commit message is getting too big, maybe
the patch needs to be split into smaller parts.

I thought the squashed patch is just for reviewing... The details about the
change is described in those separated patches I sent before.

That does make a bit more sense, but it's still confusing. So your
all-in-one patch is all patches in the 1-5 sequence? I'm assuming then
that 1, 2 and 3 never got merged. Do you know why? Would it be better
to merge them first?

If some of those patches fixes something from some previous patch(es)
and none of those got merged yet, please fix your history by rebasing
interactively first, then post the patches. The patches should be
self-contained in the sense that they do a coherent chunk of changes.

As an example of why your commit messages are currently not good
enough, consider this:

* 4/5: Avoid potential race conditions <- In which case those race
conditions occur?

* 5/5: Improve event processing a bit <- What is being improved? It
looks like the IPC interface is being changed.

Again, if you're changing the IPC protocol, you've got to explain
what's the use case and whether or not your change will break
anything.

Please consider the following: Rewrite your history, dividing the
patches into self-contained chunks of code. Use individual threads for
things that are not related. If the patches need to be applied in
order, but aren't related, you might prefer to post the first
patchset, wait for it to be reviewed and possibly merged, then post
the second, and so on. And please use more detailed descriptions in
the body of the commit message where necessary.

I'm sorry if I'm being pedantic here, but this would make it much
easier to review your patches.

Just for the record, I totally agree to what Fernando says.

I will not look at this thread / its patches until you re-send them in a way
which conforms to our general quality requirements. What those are has been
outlined by Fernando, and since you got multiple patches pushed to i3 already,
we can expect a reasonable level of quality in your patches by now :).

Best regards,
Michael

Hi all,

I think there's a paste error into i3.config.keycodes:

For mode "resize", there are some "bindsym" that should be "bindcode".

The attached patch fixes these.

cheers!

Hi i3 gurus,

I am not sure if this question has popped up here before (if so,
apologies). I have migrated from usual Ubuntu (Gnome/Unity) environment to
i3-wm, and I am still facing some small issues... I mean, I want to get rid
of the Gnome stuff and run a cleaner i3 environment.

I guess my question is: how do you use the i3? I guess the i3 is not a
complete X environment (as the name says it all: window manager), so which
desktop environment should be the best to integrate with it? A simple Xorg?
or Xfce? I am sure you guys don't use Gnome (lol)...

Right now, I am still reluctant to do everything by hand (like configuring
wifi network, setting up bluetooth, etc), so I prefer to use the
applications available out there. For network management, I am using wicd,
and liking it a lot.

I think this is too broad question, but I was hoping I could get some
insights on best ways to use the i3, without too much hassle of doing it
all manually...

For example, I am relying on gnome-settings-daemon (this one fixes
keybindings for my mac, such as brightness and volume control, as well as
terminal font, etc) and gnome-keyring-daemon (controls the password
management for applications, specially used by network managers)... and I
don't know how to get rid of them, if I want to (doing all the key mapping
by myself is doable, but too much trouble, if there are packages out there
solving this for me already).

I would like to know how, in your experience, you get to solve such
problems to run a i3 environment smoothly...

Thanks!

Hey Bruno -- I'm not a guru, but I'll share my story since I'm just a
little ways ahead of you. And I've been wanting to pipe up and shower
Michael et al with gratitude and praise for what so far looks like the
biggest workflow improvement I've found in years. THANK YOU!!

My suggestions:

* Start by blowing away a toy machine and experiment there. Or I
suppose you could be careful and just try to set up as a different
user on your main machine. My i3/GNOME integration attempt didn't go
well (but maybe it's commonly done). I'm enjoying having left GNOME
behind now anyway. So i3/X is all that's needed!

* Find someone's dotfiles online who's doing something similar. You
probably just need .xinitrc and .i3/config, (and maybe .i3status) for
starters. Mine have the bulk of the config (nm-applet, udiskie, font
setting) in .i3/config
(https://github.com/MicahElliott/dotfiles/blob/master/.i3/config) as I
found some things didn't take by just putting into .xinitrc.

* You can bind keys easily enough with xev, and xmodmap. I used to use
a crazy xkeycaps (IIRC) generated xmodmap to map keys all over the
place, but all you need is probably a few lines like in your .xinitrc:
https://github.com/MicahElliott/dotfiles/blob/master/.xinitrc . All
you absolutely need in it is: exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch i3 .
But I've also manually mapped volume controls and pm-suspend. I also
call keychain just before firing i3.

* Ease into the User's Guide http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html, the
one and only doc you really need. So nice. Work to memorize the
bindings quickly.

* Get familiarized with the non-GNOME tool set:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Common_Applications#Image_Viewers

* Use lxappearance to change fonts (and theme if you like)

* Rely on mod+r to quickly change things to your i3 config.

* Decide a multi-monitor solution. i3 "just works" with zero config,
but it's a little different. GNOME spreads a desktop across all
monitors, but i3 treats each monitor as separate. I still haven't
fully adjusted but have mapped even-numbered desktops to my top
monitor and odds to laptop screen. This way I can hit ctrl-1-2 and
later ctrl-3-4 to emulate the GNOME way. I'm mixing it up too, but
still organize windows this way to large extent. I've bound mod+tab to
quckly bounce from one desktop "back_and_forth" to the next. You can
use arandr to config monitor settings and then export to a one-line
xrandr script. I have 3 setups in ~/bin and can quickly change screens
with ~/bin/xr1 (or xr2 or xr3).

* Consider switching to Arch: rolling releases for bleeding edge of
anything, easy to make your own packages, lots of light-weight package
managers to choose from, have more control over what's on your
machine, extensive and well curated wiki and forums, and seems to be a
nice i3 cohort there. ArchBang was a decent install experience to get
graphics, network, etc working OOTB (my head looked like yours after
doing a vanilla Arch install :). And I stupidly let the installer
choose my root partition at a small size and later tried to load big
databases. So I'd recommend making / plenty big or just keeping /home
on the same partition.

* I couldn't give up my Alt key (not even close!), so mapped mod to
Win key. (Right-Alt is my tilde/backtick, so esc is more reachable.)
I'm mostly used to reaching for Win (Mod4) now, but I suppose
conquering alt/win/ctrl/shift combos for everything is like mastering
an instrument. I don't use arrow keys for anything (except stupid
browsers and spreadsheets). And as a vim user I was COMPLETELY
befuddled by the default jkl; mapping. i3 made it so easy to switch
these things (how commonly do people change it to vim's hjkl?). And
since I had to lose mod+h to the vim shift, I mapped mod+g to
horizontal, which makes some sense being near the vertical v.

* I use gimp often and i3's floating windows are working just fine for
me. Get used to holding mod and using both mouse keys for quickly
moving and resizing. Even non-floating windows benefit from
mod+right-mouse.

Superfluous background....

I'd been using Ubuntu/GNOME for the last ~5 yrs, and using 10.04 LTS
since its release. I'd done a lot of tweaking to the point that things
were just getting too brittle (and stale). I figured I'd have to make
a lot of changes to get going with Unity and now was as good a time as
ever to simplify and reorganize. I decided to do the big-bang approach
and change OS and WM all in one go. This has turned into a major time
sink the last couple weeks but looking like it'll be worth it for
another 5+ yrs of happiness (quite possibly on this same machine!).

I started with xmonad and got it working pretty well on another Arch
machine. Didn't even mind Haskell. Then put it on main system and hit
a Haskell packaging problem, bloated my machine with ghc, got into a
mess. And, was copying long recipes for xmonad/xmobar configs instead
of doing simple things that i3 supports. Also had tried awesomewm and
hit some bugs/surprises.

Thanks to the simplicity and minimalism of i3 (and Arch) I can finally
keep in my head where almost all my configs are and how to change
things (well, my vim config is still a bit messy). I'm now on a small
(and fast!) SSD and still have plenty of space. I can get new packages
every day and all the tools I'm using are brand new. I love the tiny
i3status and I've gone with the 1pixel window border that is working
so nicely (mod+b is mapped to cycle *b*order modes; I like titles on
some things like browsers). I've finally utilized every pixel, have
custom tiny fonts on everything, and have reached WM nirvana. I could
never get to this point of beautiful simplicity with GNOME.

I am not limited by CPU resources, RAM or disk speed, so my preferences
are mostly about the convenience of the environment.

Usually due to different reasons I do install both Gnome & KDE with all
their applications, but I only use a few of them at a time.

Current setup:
 1. Chromium as a browser
 2. Claws-mail as primary mail client (99% of usage), and Apline as
 backup. (also have Thunderbird installed but not much used at all)
 3. Wicd as network manager.
 4. Skype (just as is)
 5. Pidgin as a multi-client for all other IMs (a few Jabber , ICQ
    accounts, MSN, Yahoo, AIM for talking with various customers)
 6. Dropbox
 7. Parcellite.
 8. Emacs (99%) or Kate as text editors.
 9. xterm as a main basic terminal. I do have Konsole (from KDE)
    and gnome-terminal, but don't use them because they are both slow
    to appear/work and also cluttered with a lot of unnecessary details.
 10. dmenu to run apps
 11. kde dialogs as a file-mime processor
 12. direct control of brightness from python script
 13. same about sound volume
 14. a set of programs to sleep, restore, add/remove external monitor
 etc.
 15. htop
 16. iptraf - network stats


Exactly:
 1) Chromium

tied via key:
bindsym Mod4+c exec /home/avk/bin/chromium

 2) I just run it via dmenu. typing 'cla' and RETURN

 3) wicd. I both start it in .xinitrc AND also have a hotkey
    to run it in text terminal:

bindsym Mod4+n exec xterm -e wicd-curses

 4,5,6,7) Skype just starts in ~/.xinitrc or manually

#!/bin/bash

for p in `cat ~/.tray-progs`
do
    if test -z "`ps axf|grep $p|grep -v grep`"
	then
	echo Starting $p ...
	$p &
	else
	echo Skipping already started program: $p ...
    fi
done

where: ~/.tray-progs are:
wicd-client dropbox parcellite skype pidgin
 
 8) My emacs config: http://avk-emacs.hg.public.halogen-dg.com/

 9) xterm settings (in ~/.Xresources)

xterm*geometry: 80x25
xterm*faceName: dejavu sans mono
xterm*faceSize: 11
xterm*saveLines: 10000
xterm*background: #0c2f35
xterm*foreground:       #f5deb3

 10) dmenu
bindsym Mod4+r exec dmenu_run -fn
 '-xos4-*-bold-*-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-1' -nb '#222222' -sf
 '#00ff00' -sb '#050505' -nf "#ffffff"

 11) KDE dialogs, add this in ~/.xinitrc:
export DE=kde
 12) 
# monitor brightness
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp   exec incr_brightness
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec decr_brightness

~/bin/incr_brightness:
sudo ~/bin/_brightness.py -i

.py:
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import optparse

BR_FILE = '/sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness'
BR_MAX = 10
BR_MIN = 0


def br_set(value):
    open(BR_FILE,"w").write("%d\n" % value)


def br_increase(current):
    if current >= BR_MAX:
        print "can not increase more then %d" % BR_MAX
        return
    br_set((current+1))

def br_decrease(current):
    if current <= BR_MIN:
        print "can not decrease less then %d" % BR_MIN
        return
    br_set((current-1))


def main():
    p = optparse.OptionParser()
    p.add_option("--increase", '-i', action='store_true')
    p.add_option("--decrease", '-d', action='store_true')
    p.add_option("--set", '-s')
    options, arguments = p.parse_args()
    current = int(open(BR_FILE).read())
    if options.increase:
        br_increase(current)
    elif options.decrease:
        br_decrease(current)
    elif options.set:
        br_set(int(options.set))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()


 13) sound:

bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec amixer set Master 2dB+
bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec amixer set Master 2dB-
bindsym XF86AudioMute exec amixer set Master toggle

 14) dwm_sleep:
#!/bin/bash
xlock &
sudo ~avk/bin/sleep_mem

sleep_mem:
echo mem > /sys/power/state


 15) htop - nice program to see processlist

bindsym Mod4+Escape exec xterm -e sudo htop

 16) iptraf - network stats

bindsym Mod1+F1 exec xterm -e sudo iptraf

Thats just a quick answer. If you have particular questions please ask
me.

Good luck with i3! 

 WBR, Alex

Some alternatives that work well with i3:

Gnome's NetworkManager also works great. Invoke nm-applet from the i3
config and you'll get a tray icon (the same tray icon you get in
Gnome). I think  wicd has a GUI too, but I never tried wicd.

> ?7. Parcellite.

This is great if you want to merge the X copy and paste buffer with
the toolkit's ^C + ^V buffers (Windows-like, perhaps more familiar
shortcuts). Clipboard history too.

Note that this is not required for all setups.

> ?13. same about sound volume

This can be done from scripts, or you can use a program like
volumeicon-alsa. With volumeicon-alsa, you also get a tray icon.

I'm totally biased here, but if you're running PulseAudio, I recommend
pa-applet. As with volumeicon-alsa, you can control the volume with
the multimedia keys in your keyboard or by interacting with the tray
icon, and you can also use the tray icon to change the audio
configuration. E.g., you can choose between HDMI or laptop speakers
using the tray icon (no need to restart programs, thanks to
PulseAudio's magic).

> ?14. a set of programs to sleep, restore, add/remove external monitor

I use a script for handling other outputs. I'm not entirely happy with
it, but for the time being it works okay:

http://pastebin.com/uiF1by2w

I plan to come up with something more flexible eventually, perhaps in
the form of another tray icon. If anybody knows of an existing
solution, please let me know.

Hi,

There is no harm installing i3-wm beside your normal Ubuntu GNOME
desktop environment. You can choose the i3 session at GDM login
screen. And try out various applications, whatever it comes from.

My initial i3 experience was on a laptop installed Xubuntu, that is
Ubuntu with Xfce desktop environment, because I was heard that Ubuntu
may have a wider support of different hardwares. Switching to a tiling
window manager was very pleasant. Later I got a desktop computer to
work with, and I installed Debian.

For Debian, you can only install a base system, and reboot to your new
system, then choose exactly those packages you need. Xorg + i3 will
suffice, no GNOME, no KDE. But I installed "Thunar", the GUI file
manager from Xfce, which can help me automatically mount a USB stick
when it's plugged in.

The point is you choose the appropriate application to your liking,
e.g., wicd-curses or nm-applet to manage your network, or just use
static network setup like I'm doing in my Debian system; and I like to
use alsamixer to control the volumes in the terminal, but obviously
there are a lot of different applets to achieve this same task.

The other packages I installed including SLIM as the display manager,
mrxvt & urxvt as terminal emulators, Iceweasel (the "Firefox" on
Debian) & chromium as web browsers, and scim, the Chinese input
method. Ocassionally I would use Icedove (the "Thunderbird" on Debian)
and pidgin. Adding xscreensaver, these are almost the full list of X
applications on my system now.

Regards,
Xia

Hi Elliott,

Thanks a lot for you thorough insight! Specially the dotfiles are being
very helpful to understand things I can do in the i3 config (which is not
exactly documented in the site).

I've been using i3 for a couple of months now, and I can say that it will
be hard to like anything else ever again... I always had at my disposal
large monitor space, so basically rearranging windows were my biggest pain.

I did before some mapping myself with xmodmap, but since I installed the
new Ubuntu and it just worked, I thought that I was kind of reinventing the
wheel... but I see, from your experience that it is all about being in
control of your machine. I get that... I think I will go in same direction.

Arch has always caught my attention here because in most of my problems I
end up reaching a blog of arch users, where I finally find my answer, so
good advice as well. I think I just got too used to the aptitude and debian
packages... I was thinking about going to debian, but since you've said it,
I will take a more careful look into it. Thanks.

The alt key was also one of the things that bothered me at first, specially
because I am so used to use the alt key for other stuff, like for browser
shortcuts.

The Gimp for me was a bad experience, even with the floating windows and
all, but the most recent updates that remove the floating menus, are a
salvation for me in i3 environment... libre-office, however, leaves some of
them out unless I dock them all, a bit weird... since I don't use that very
often, I can survive as it is.

Thanks again for your inputs. It was pretty helpful!

Cheers,

I am currently running linux on a macbook pro machine, which makes
everything a bit more challenging to get working, but I am almost there...
surely, with these advises, I will be able to finish up the rest of stuff
bothering me and ditch Ubuntu/Gnome as a desktop environment for good.

Hei Fernando,

Thanks! Some comments in-line...

I had some issues with nm because of my drivers, and decided to give it a
try to wicd... it is working great (you have more powerful stuff on it, and
the freaking icon shows up in the i3 bar). But somehow, when the network is
down, it leaves dirt in the ifconfig, so the i3status still thinks I am
connected, until I force a ifconfig down... this is weird, but I haven't
looked into it in details yet.

The gnome-terminal accepts ctrl+shift+c/v, which is pretty handy (the
original ctrl+c is used to break/stop scripts/programs)... do you know a
mapping in xterm in similar way?

Yeah, it seems to be the way to do this... :S

I really liked it! the gnome-sound-applet also worked for me, but the icon
size is too large for i3bar, so it would not show up (like nm-applet).
This one here goes to my list of startup programs! :-)

This one here is still a bit fuzzy for me... I am just using the
gnome-settings-daemon, and everything magically works... trying to do it
manually ws a bit pain, but I got it working with the pm-suspend command
(sudo required).

Thanks for your input here!

Hi Xia,

That's one of the ideas I had in mind... Debian or Arch, but I am more
tended to Debian because I am so used to Aptitude and the deb packages...

I think you are totally right... as a newbie in the i3wm, I wanted to get
everyone's opinion and experience with it, so I don't go through the
hardest way of doing things... Just by reading everyone's comments here, I
already found some issues on my own to solve.

Do you have any issues with keyrings? No one commented about it, but, for
example in my case, if I don't have the gnome-keyring-daemon running, other
applications that store passwords simply don't work (eg. wicd, polly,
empathy, pidgin, etc), well, they do work, but they do not store the
password, so if you restart it, it will prompt all over again... So I was
wondering what would be the keyring manager for i3...

This I am particularly interested, because I need to write Japanese,
Portuguese and Chinese on my machine. I am currently using ibus, which is
the default from Ubuntu, and it works in i3 as well, so I did not bother
looking for better approaches. Is SLIM better?

Thanks again!

We are aware of that fact. In case anybody wants to help to get things going, a
nice article about your setup with your config and additional programs (like
the mailing list posts), possibly with a few screenshots, are a wonderful
contribution.

I?d then add these to the website as example setups.

Is English mandatory or do you also welcome an article in french ?
(Quickier for me to write something in french, but english is
possible.)

And what about the desired format ? LaTeX/PDF is suitable ? Or do you
prefer something else ? (Except of course Ms-Word ;-)

Tia,

HTML. It will use the same (or a very similar) stylesheet as i3wm.org itself
(being a subsection), so please don?t use custom styles.

Michael,

I would gladly try to help on that. I will try to compile what I have
gathered here (and from other sources) and suggest improvements to the
documentation.

I believe that having a thorough doc of the most used applications, in
terms of best practices to put them working with i3, would be a great place
to start.

I will let you know as soon as I have something consistent and worthy of
your review.

Best Regards,

Ok. I'm by no means an HTML ninja, but will see what I can do ;)

I'll suppose that you can make something with a basic LibreOffice HTML
document, without frills.

Hi all,
I use linux since 9 months so I am still learning new things about it
I3 was my first choice after looking at quite some number of windows
managers like ratpoison or musica etc.

To exhance i3 I use conky with dzen2. I compiled my own latest
versions (conky to avoid startup bug and dzen2 to support xft fonts).
Here are my config files: conky - http://pastebin.com/DAbJkdTK  i3:
http://pastebin.com/5a1bEehc and python script to notify about emails:
http://pastebin.com/SA4UAeiU . Note that config is designed for dvorak
for programmers keyboard layout.

Here is short list of other programs that  I use in the order of frequency:
urxvt-256color - a terminal customised to support copy-paste, link clicking etc
    config file at http://pastebin.com/xCEPvC6f
    By the way I find DejaVu Sans Mono to be the best fixed-width font
with decent unicode support.
firefox (actually iceweasel) with pentadactyl as main plugin to
minimize mouse usage. Here is my pentadactyl
config:http://pastebin.com/MSa7r8ve . Some more addons that I
sometimes use (I have several profiles) Adblock, Gnome-keyring,
FaviconizeTab, Noscript, DomainDetails, GreaseMonkey, Firebug,
Wappalyzer, Lazarus, User Agent Switcher, View Dependencies and some
other pentesting stuff.
fbxkbd - for icon for changing keyboard layout
vim - for java, latex, c++ etc (with heavy customisation) - more than
40 kb of config files :P
zsh for shell and other stuff is more common like pidgin, parcellite.

The things I am still looking for are:
- good  two panel file manager with key customization (vifm is so far
the best I found but it is terminal based and it is impossible to bind
some keys like shift tab)
- lightweiht login manager - I use gdm at the moment.
- good way to rebind keys - at the moment I am using xautomation
package but what I failed to do with it is to unify the key to exit
from applications. (like ctrl+q - but when I bind ctr+q to send ctrl+q
using xev in i3 config, bad things happen). The only solution I see is
to add window title/id bindings in i3. I have it in my todo list but
it wil for sure not have time to do it for next 3 months.
Those are my 3 cents...

Hi Bruno,

I have never used the gnome-keyring, so I can't provide any comments.

For me the SLIM can provide a login screen, and let me start my i3
session, this is all I need, and a little better than typing "startx"
from the terminal, so I use it. :-P

Regards,
Xia.

Just wanted to ask if anyone has faced this problem before, and what you
did about it.

Every time I leave a tab in the browser with a flash running (eg. youtube),
it also gets displayed on other workspaces (refer to attachment). The weird
thing is that taking a screenshot of the window, nothing shows up, so I
took a photo using my mobile...

Thanks!

Hi Bruno,

I think this is common issue with Adobe Flash Player and nVidia
proprietary drivers. I guess it can be solved by disabling hardware
acceleration of flash. The system-wide settings is in /etc/adobe/mms.cfg
but disabling it in there may not work. Probalby there is per user settings
somewhere in your home (not sure where exactly). But you can right-click
on a flash video go to settings and disable the hardware acceleration
in there. Another issue is this internal flash menu is sometimes
unclickable (it just ignores your mouse). Then you have to fullscreen
the flash video at first (on youtube perhaps). Yeah. This is kinda funny
and tricky. But if i remember it worked for me.

Subject: [i3] Window decoration colors unexpectedly different after upgrade
	to 4.2
Message-ID: <20120515055337.GA18517@s70206.gridserver.com>

Hi,

After upgrading i3 to version 4.2 (from 3.x ...don't recall the
exact version), the colors of the window decorations are unexpectedly
different. For example, this will make a black background:
    client.focused #4D4D4D #000000 #AACCBB

and this will make a white background:
    client.focused #4D4D4D #FFFFFF #AACCBB

But now, with this:
    client.focused #4D4D4D #555555 #AACCBB

...the background looks quite turquoise. I'd expect #555555 to make
for a shade of grey.

Below is the color-related section from my ~/.i3/config file. All the
#rrggbb values are making unexpected colors, biased towards shades of
green. Is there some setting that might be affecting this?

    #                        border      background  text
    client.focused           #4D4D4D    #2C2D2E     #AACCBB
    client.unfocused         #2C2D2E    #2C2D2E     #707678
    client.focused_inactive  #2C2D2E    #2C2D2E     #AACCBB
    client.urgent            #FEA63C    #4D4D4D     #FFE863

    bar {
        colors {
            background #000000
            statusline #ffffff
            focused_workspace  #77AA99 #3D3D3D  #AACCBB
            active_workspace   #77AA99 #3D3D3D  #AACCBB
            inactive_workspace #2C2D2E #2C2D2E  #707678
            urgent_workspace   #FEA63C #4D4D4D  #FFE863
        }
    }

Thanks for any help,

John

Subject: [i3] Problem with switching to named workspaces
Message-ID: <4FB28B78.40301@yahoo.de>

  On my never ending journey to find the optimal tiling WM I am 
currently fiddling with i3 and til reallynow I like it.

All is working fine, it is very configurable and easy to do that, thanks 
for the great work.
The only problem I have is that I can't switch to named workspaces that 
begin with a number, like described in the manual.
For example, I want to auto-start Firefox and also want it to launch 
every time on the workspace named 1: Web, which is easily done with 
these lines in the configuration file:

exec firefox
assign [class = "Firefox"] 1: Web

There is no problem with that. The problem is that I can't switch to 
workspaces named like that using the keyboard.
I tried all of the following lines in my configuration file, but none 
worked:

bindsym Mod4+1 workspace 1
bindsym Mod4+1 workspace 1: Web
bindsym Mod4+1 workspace "1: Web"
bindsym Mod4+1 workspace number 1

Has anyone a clue what I am doing wrong? I simply can't figure it out.

Make sure that you don?t have trailing whitespace, tabs, etc. here.

This will not work, it looks for "1".

> bindsym Mod4+1 workspace 1: Web
> bindsym Mod4+1 workspace "1: Web"
Those should work, assuming you don?t have trailing whitespace etc. above.

> bindsym Mod4+1 workspace number 1
This has to work. At this point I suspect you are doing something very wrong,
like having two keybindings for the same key. Or not actually pressing Mod4+1.
Or modifying the wrong config file.

In any case, make sure you use a recent version of i3 (you need 4.2 for the
"workspace number" command), and provide us with i3 --version.

Also, see http://i3wm.org/docs/debugging.html in case the problem persists and
provide a compressed (!) logfile.

Best regards,
Michael

It turns out this has nothing to do with i3, but rather a setting
in /etc/X11/xorg.conf. When upgrading i3, X was also upgraded and
I regenerated my xorg.conf file. In this section:

    Section "Screen"
            Identifier "Screen0"
            DefaultColorDepth 16

Changing DefaultColorDepth from 16 to 24 fixed the problem, now all
the colors are displayed properly.

With apologies for the noise,

John

Yep, that worked for me too! Thanks a bunch!

Very tricky to get the menu back on fullscreen mode (I would never figure

Truncated logfiles are useless. Please open a ticket at bugs.i3wm.org and
attach the compressed complete logfile with detailed steps to reproduce.

Hi there,

I've been using i3 for a while now, and really appreciate it.
There's only one thing that makes me crazy: I recently started to play go
again (some board game), and the application is written in java.
The issue is that very often, when opening a window, it won't be drawn,
I'll just get a gray window (see attached screenshot).
I can't play correctly with i3, and this is a i3 issue, I never got that
issue with xfce/e17 when I was playing that game 1+ year ago.

My i3 version is 4.2 .  Couldn't find any log refering to that issue. Went
through the java manpage and tried the option -Xrs without success (Reduces
use of operating-system signals by the JVM).

Does someone have a similar issue with java applications ? Any ideas on how
to solve it ?

Thanks for your support :)

Hello Tobias,

I remember that I had problems with this function, too. One very
simple idea helped me very much and I think all problems were gone:
use variables for the workspace name!

    set $mod Mod4

    set $wsp1 1: WWW
    set $wsp2 2
    set $wsp3 3: EMACS
    set $wsp4 4
    set $wsp5 5
    set $wsp6 6
    set $wsp7 7
    set $wsp8 8: MAIL
    set $wsp9 9: IM

    bindsym $mod+1 workspace $wsp1
    bindsym $mod+Shift+exclam      move workspace $wsp1

This simplifies renaming and general handling of workspaces and you
can be sure that you don't mess up your name with typos, whitespace
and the like.

BTW: I have to repeat that i3 is sooooo great :) Thanks to the developers!

Correct, thanks for that. Unfortunately, I cannot merge it, since you did not
use 'git format-patch'. May I ask you to use it and resend the patch please?

Best regards,
Michael

PS: No need to send the patch directly to me ? I got it, but just haven?t had
the time to review it until now :).

Hi Michael,

Somehow I lost this message here. Sorry for the late reply.

I just wondered that, because if the ISO10646, both Chinese or Japanese (or
any other language character for that matter) could be properly rendered,
the same way the browser is capable of doing it.

It actually does not bother me that much, but it would be nice to solve
this, which increases odds for more international adoption.

What would be your suggestion to handle this? Any ideas?

Regards,

Note that i3 falls back to "fixed". So it might be that you aren't
using the font that you have specified, but rather the fallback font.

I mentioned this here before, but in any case, I have patches for
Pango support in i3. Pango should render whatever you throw at it
(provided that the font supports the scripts, of course) and allow RTL
language support, besides other niceties such as antialiasing,
subpixel rendering, hinting, etc. If you or anyone else is interested,
please ping me.

Hi,

I use this settings for font in ~/.config/i3/config:
font -wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-medium-r-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso10646-1

There is a snapshot, I grabbed some random Japanese text and made a
directory, then cd into it to display the text in the window title:
http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/61260048gw1dt28l6s221j.jpg

The font should be installed from one of these packages, but I don't
know exactly which, because I installed all of them:
xfonts-intl-chinese-big - International fonts for X -- Chinese big
xfonts-intl-chinese - International fonts for X -- Chinese
ttf-wqy-microhei - A droid derived Sans-Seri style CJK font
ttf-wqy-zenhei - "WenQuanYi Zen Hei" A Hei-Ti Style (sans-serif) Chinese font
xfonts-wqy - WenQuanYi Bitmap Song CJK font for X

By the way, the font setting for urxvt is as follows:
URxvt.font:			-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1,-wenquanyi-wenquanyi
bitmap song-medium-r-normal--13-130-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1

I think the "fixed" typeface may not have non-latin glyphs?

Regards,
Xia.

Hei Xia,

Thanks for the info... I guess you are right.

I tried a combination of different fonts, but could not find one that fit
Japanese and Chinese altogether.

I installed the packages you advised but the font could not be loaded by
i3, I guess it is because I could not find them in the xfontsel either...
any thoughts on why are they not available as they were supposed to?

Thanks again!

Hi Bruno,

I noted that the font is a "bitmap" font, I think the package should
be "xfonts-wqy - WenQuanYi Bitmap Song CJK font for X" (at least for
Debian squeeze).
$ apt-cache search wqy
ttf-wqy-microhei - A droid derived Sans-Seri style CJK font
ttf-wqy-zenhei - "WenQuanYi Zen Hei" A Hei-Ti Style (sans-serif) Chinese font
xfonts-wqy - WenQuanYi Bitmap Song CJK font for X

I get the "font description" line from "xlsfonts" command, you may try
this to get the font description line:

$ xlsfonts | grep wenquanyi | grep 10646
-wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-bold-r-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso10646-1
-wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-bold-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-119-iso10646-1
-wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-bold-r-normal--13-130-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1
-wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-bold-r-normal--15-150-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1
-wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-bold-r-normal--16-160-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1
-wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-medium-r-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso10646-1
-wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-p-119-iso10646-1
-wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-medium-r-normal--13-130-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1
-wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-medium-r-normal--15-150-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1
-wenquanyi-wenquanyi bitmap song-medium-r-normal--16-160-75-75-p-80-iso10646-1

This font should contain Chinese and probably Japanese as I
experimented before, but I find that it does not have Korean
characters.

I found using "xlsfonts" to try out different font configurations more
reliable than using "xfontsel", though this is more cumbersome.

If it's still not working, I suggest you may just try some other typefaces.

Regards, Xia.
