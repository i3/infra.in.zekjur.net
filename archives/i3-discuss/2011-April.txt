Shouldn't it be "WM_TAKE_FOCUS"? Where am I wrong?

It shouldn?t (since commit 86117db4345190302b73ca4e95e8431459b3868b). Are you
sure you did 'make clean' before making? Compilation works fine for me here.

Best regards,
Michael

hi,

is it possible or does anyone know about existing tray program, that
stays on all workspaces for i3?
i'm using dzen2+stalonetray.

dzen2 completely meet my needs of bar, but i can't force stalonetray
to stay on all workspaces :(

thanks for hints

There's an open enhancement request asking for sticky clients (#11),
that might solve your problem in the long term.

I haven't used a "tray area" in some time now, but I remember pypanel
and fbpanel worked well (if you don't mind an extra bar). I don't know
if they'll work properly with i3 as i3 doesn't support all hints (for
workspace switching with the pager, for example).

Hope that helps.

hi,

finally i've got some time to spend with i3
the 'tree' branch compiles, but

i3: ev.c:2621: ev_io_start: Assertion `("libev: ev_io_start called
with negative fd", fd >= 0)' failed.

while starting, so i couldn test anything on this...

anyway, i've got snapping patch for the master branch
http://home.zcu.cz/~honza801/i3-floating.diff

features: snapps floating windows, snap floating window to the
workspace, align even non-touching floating windows on the workspace

please enjoy and keep in mind, that i'm not a C-programator

I haven't really looked at the patch (thanks anyways, it's always
appreciated), but can you reproduce it with the current -tree? If so,
could you please add a printf (or DLOG or whatever) above each call to
ev_io_start (3 in main.c, 1 in ipc.c) and file a bug report?

hi,
made your wishes come true

04/22/2011 10:44:23 AM - main.c: ev_io_start ipc_io
04/22/2011 10:44:23 AM - main.c: ev_io_start xcb_watcher
i3: ev.c:2621: ev_io_start: Assertion `("libev: ev_io_start called
with negative fd", fd >= 0)' failed.
Aborted

so the problem is in theese lines of main.c

ev_io_init(xcb_watcher, xcb_got_event, xcb_get_file_descriptor(conn), EV_READ);
LOG("main.c: ev_io_start xcb_watcher\n");
ev_io_start(loop, xcb_watcher);

do you need any additional informations?
btw, i'm trying to run i3 in the Xnest, could this be the problem?

hi again,

the problem was in the Xnest, running it on vt works good, but...

the second problem is in the randr extension.
in src/randr.c: void randr_init function breaks the file descriptor of
the xcb via xcb_randr_select_input function

i think that all the xrandr functions shouldn't be called if the
xrandr extension is missing. anyway the debug log says "Checking for
XRandR..." but it does not check anythink, it just calls the randr
functions.

so, here is my patched rand_init function, it is definetly NOT a good
workaround, but it works. ;)

void randr_init(int *event_base) {
    const xcb_query_extension_reply_t *extreply;

    extreply = xcb_get_extension_data(conn, &xcb_randr_id);
    if (!extreply->present) {
        disable_randr(conn);
        return;
    }

    randr_query_outputs();

    if (event_base != NULL)
        *event_base = extreply->first_event;

    xcb_randr_select_input(conn, root,
            XCB_RANDR_NOTIFY_MASK_SCREEN_CHANGE |
            XCB_RANDR_NOTIFY_MASK_OUTPUT_CHANGE |
            XCB_RANDR_NOTIFY_MASK_CRTC_CHANGE |
            XCB_RANDR_NOTIFY_MASK_OUTPUT_PROPERTY);

    xcb_flush(conn);
}

hope this helped...

regards
fous

Thanks for the info. I can reproduce that one, xcb_get_file_descriptor
is returning -1 in Xnest. The docs for xcb_get_file_descriptor say:

"Accessor for the file descriptor that was passed to the
xcb_connect_to_fd call that returned c. "

The way I see it, we it doesn't guarantee we'll get a descriptor
unless we used xcb_connect_to_fd instead of xcb_connect, but it seems
natural that xcb_connect would call xcb_connect_to_fd. I wouldn't be
surprised if this was just a bug in XCB or Xnest. Xnest is kinda dead
these days, isn't it? I think Xephyr is the new "de facto" X within X,
and i3-tree does work in Xephyr.

It looks correct to me, I don't see why we would want to be notified
about RandR events if we don't support them. But then again I don't
know anything about RandR.

Subject: [i3] ipc.c: unaligned memory accesses on sparc
Message-ID: <20110428081311.GA2517@cvs.openbsd.org>


Hi!

There's an unaligned memory accesses on sparc that makes i3 crash
when you run i3-wsbar or i3bar by Merovius.

Here's the backtrace:

The program is running.  Exit anyway? (y or n)


The following diff fixes the issue for me:
