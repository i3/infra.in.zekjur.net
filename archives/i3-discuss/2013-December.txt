Hi guys, I was just wondering if these patches made their way upstream?

Subject: [i3] Multiwindow-Apps (Gnome, Inkscape, xchat and others) in i3
Message-ID: <20131211132436.GA2745@siouxsie>

Hello,

yesterday I tried to use Inkscape under i3.
When opening "object properties", the window
filled the whole screen, and my worksheet,
the main-window of the app was not visible anymore.

Similar problems did I have with other apps that use multiple windows.
An example would be Gimp in multi-window-mode, xchat (after channel search),
and there will be many more.

A program that - as counter-example - behaves well under i3 is
R. When doing a plot, a window opens and shows the plot,
and the window is opened in the same mode, in which I
set i3 (horizontal or vertical).

But the other apps, mentioned above, just open the windows somewhere, and
seemingly not predictable, and it makes these programs being
unconformtable or even unusable.

Possibly these apps open any window in "floating mode" (?).

A while ago, when I used wmii (before switching to i3),
I asked the Gimp-developers about this problem, and
how to solve it.
The answer was, that nearly nobody would use things like wmii,
so they will not support this, it's my problem, not theirs.

The single-window-mode then helped using Gimp on i3 also,
but with inkscape for example, the problem stays there.

Any ideas, on how to use such applications in i3?
Can i3 be set up in a way to handle these problems,
or would it need the applications to be changed?


Ciao,
   Oliver

Hi,

try to create for_window rules that force the mentioned windows to tiled
mode (floating disable), like:

for_window[title="GNU Image*"] floating disable

The best solution, in my opinion, is to let i3 float these windows.

This is done with for_window[0].

As an example, my i3 defaults the message composing window of
Thunderbird to floating mode with:

for_window [class="^Thunderbird$" instance="^Msgcompose$"] floating enable

HI,

I have configured all of my chat windows to go to a different workspace
(say "chat" workspace) using for_window and floating enabled.

when A movie is watched in another workspace (say "personal" workspace),
and suddenly a chat window appears - I'm using chrome hangouts plugin,
which open separate window for each conversation - and vlc is swapped to
the chat workspace and the new popup in the current workspace.

This is a bug, isn't it?

this is the configuration:

for_window [class="Google-chrome"
instance="crx_nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd"] floating enable; move
container to workspace chat

You can use xprop to help you doing this:

1. Run `xprop|grep WM_CLASS` in a terminal and click the
target window.

2. This would give, for example:
WM_CLASS(STRING) = "inkscape", "Inkscape"

3. Then add a line to your i3 config file:
for_window[instance="^inkscape$" class="^Inkscape$"] floating disable

for_window use command criteria, you can get more details here:
http://i3-wm.org/docs/userguide.html#command_criteria

There is a subtle mistake in your configuration: you should use a comma,
not a semicolon, to separate these commands:

for_window [class="Google-chrome" instance="crx_nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd"] floating enable, move container to workspace chat

I realized that this is not covered in the userguide, so I just added
this section:

When using multiple commands, separate them by using a +,+ (a comma) instead of
a semicolon. Criteria apply only until the next semicolon, so if you use a
semicolon to separate commands, only the first one will be executed for the
matched window(s).

Yes, that works :-)

Thanks so much :-)

Now the new window is opened as a tile.
I can see my original window, and possibly switch
the opened tile to a seperate workspace :-)

If I understand correctly, it should be possible to do even that
by using the i3-config....

Ciao,
   Oliver

Subject: [i3] Layout saving/restoring (PREVIEW)
Message-ID: <x6y53lbz0h.fsf@midna.zekjur.net>

Hi,

I have been working on layout/session saving/restoring this
weekend. The title is a mouthful, but what it?s about is saving parts of
your layout (say, an entire workspace) to a JSON file and later loading
that into i3.

This is useful for multiple things:

1) Restoring a certain layout when starting up your x session.
   People used to do this with shell scripts and hacks such as
   i3-exec-wait until now.

2) Defining a more elaborate default layout for certain workspaces. As
   an example, on my big screen I like to have three columns of stacked
   containers with terminals in them, where the middle one is larger
   than the left and right ones.

I uploaded a video to demonstrate how it looks:
http://youtu.be/CaDOfwxXc9g

To save a layout, there is i3-save-tree(1), which requires the Perl
modules AnyEvent::I3? and JSON::XS?. i3-save-tree --workspace=1 prints
workspace 1?s layout to stdout. You are expected to edit that layout
file briefly, especially the ?swallows? sections of each container. The
criteria should be familiar to you, e.g. from for_window.

Once you have done that, you can use the append_layout command to load a
layout file.

As for the code, I just pushed the branch ?session-saving?, which you
can build and use right now. It?s stable enough that I?m using it on my
main machine. But, since this is a very new feature, be prepared to
encounter some stability issues (e.g. layout files that could crash
i3). You have been warned! :)

Also note that I reserve the right to break this feature in any way that
I deem necessary, and you have no right to complain about layout file or
new command breakage :).

As for the release plan: I intend to release i3 4.7 soonish (maybe in a
week or so). After that is done, I?ll merge the session-saving branch
into the ?next? branch, i.e. the earliest i3 release that can possibly
have this feature will be 4.8.

It is more like a session manager, have you ever considered to
implement a simple flexible session manager for i3 wm.

 From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_session_manager, what you are 
doing is actually fall into the concept of a X session manager for 
i3-wm, it might be better to be called as i3-sm which is short for i3 
session manager.

So you are saying it should be a separate project? I disagree. The
support for that needs to be tightly integrated into i3, and defining an
interface for that is more trouble than it?s worth. Furthermore, if you
look at the actual implementation, the only _new_ code (apart from bug
fixes) is the handling of placeholder windows. i3-save-tree is an
external Perl script.

In conclusion, I still don?t know what you are trying to argue for. I
also don?t think it?s worth pursuing that part of the discussion, so
unless you have really strong feelings and can make a case for whatever
it is that you are trying to say, I?m inclined to not answer anymore
:). Thanks for understanding.

FYI: I just merged the session-saving branch into the ?next? branch, so
it?s on track for a release in i3 v4.8. Please help by testing it and
sending feedback!

(To be very explicit: this means you should switch back to ?next? now,

Hi
Thank you for introducing this feature. It's going to be another great 
feature of an already great window manager.
Does that mean that the 2 perl modules are likely to become i3 
dependencies in the future?

I'm trying to build the 'next' branch without luck. I mean it builds 
find but I can't seem to find the i3-save-tree command in the 
installation directory. I've installed the additional perl modules, 
cloned the git repo, switched to the next branch, double checked that 
the i3-save tree exists in the directory (see the pastebin link), make, 
make install DESTDIR=install_dir but the i3-save-tree script is nowhere 
to be seen in the install directory (install_dir). Would I be incorrect 
thinking that it should be with other scripts in usr/bin/? Please advise.

Thank you
Marcin

In Debian, this translates into a Recommends:, not a Depends:. For other
distributions, this may mean a dependency, yeah.

Subject: [i3] py3status v1.1 released
Message-ID: <52BC6CFF.4000303@ultrabug.net>

Dear list,

After the initial release in January and the v1.0 in August, I'm glad to 
announce the latest and feature rich version of py3status v1.1.

What is py3status ?
-------------------------
It is a user-contributed project which gives you an easy and flexible 
way to display your own stuff in your i3barby wrapping your current 
i3status configuration. See [2] for more info.

New major features since release v1.0 [1]
-----------------------------------------------------
- Support for i3bar click events on your own modules (need i3 v4.6)
- You can now take action on clicks made on your i3status modules thanks 
to py3status ![3]

Enhancements / bug fixes
---------------------------------
- Overall responsiveness of modules and py3status output management
- Totally asynchronous processing of i3status and user modules
- More intuitive module output ordering in your i3bar
- Respect user's locale for time transformation
- Allow float on refresh interval option for high speed refresh of your 
bar while still keeping low I/O footprint thanks to the integrated 
py3status caching

Example modules
-----------------------
- the new i3bar_click_events.py module allows you to implement some 
actions when clicking on your i3bar modules
- the pomodoro example has been rewritten to use click events
- new whoami module to show your current login name on your bar

Fancy a chat or need help ?
-----------------------------------
Feel free to join the #py3status IRC channel on FreeNode to get help or 
share your ideas !

Thanks
---------
For their issues ranging from #15 to #20 with feedback, proposals and 
pull requests !

Subject: [i3] Feature request: ion3-style "float split"
Message-ID: <20131228233309.GA9711@senco>

Hi,

the upcoming i3 layout restore feature almost completes my wishlist. The only
thing lacking is the "float split" that ion3 had. I fired up notion just to make
this 2-frame gif-animation showing the feature in action:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20179139/ion3-float-split.gif 

With the float split you could make two[1] containers overlap each other. The
amount of overlap was controlled similarly as you would resize a window. And the
layout stayed that way until changed it again.

I used to have firefox with docs on one side, and vim on the other. It worked
wonders for my productivity and I miss it sorely. With that implemented i3 would
be complete :)

So, I accept the feature either as built-in, or as a working script[2]. Either
way is fine ;)

Thanks for the great wm!

 - Eero

[1] or maybe even more, but I only ever used two.
[2] note that the containers overlap; a scripter couldn't get away with just
resizing two side-by-size containers since it would trigger a redraw on the
clients and that would mess things up. A possible solution could be using two
floaters and switching back and forth between them...

Hi Eero,

Why not use an horizontal layout and switch to full screen as needed ?

Your use case feels weird to me, i3 is a windows tiling manager.

Because that usually causes the browser to rerender it's content. It may not
seem like a big deal, but when you're writing code with million things in your
head at once, and your split-second what-was-that-functions-third-keyword
-glance turns into where-the-hell-is-that-function and again
what-was-i-even-doing.

Here's an interactive demo of the phenomenon; point your browser to
http://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.extract , start
resizing your browser back and forth and see how the lines fly to who knows
where :)

Another point in keeping your browser to a certain width instead of fullscreen,
is that text is easier to read if the page is narrower.

As my 1440x900 screen is too narrow to keep a browser and a terminal
side-by-side, and too wide to keep them both at fullscreen, the natural thing to
do here would be to make them overlap a bit so that they both feel just the
right size :)

Hi Eero,

Thank you for the explanation.

Did you try to send the browser window to the scratchpad ? What's your
experience with it ?

I tried even that, but it doesn't work too good.

I currently mimic the functionality shown it the gif by having a narrow terminal
beside the browser just for padding, and keep a terminal with tmux on the
scratchpad. It works well enough.

I hope that Michael runs out of ideas and implements this feature out of
boredom, if nothing else ;)

That?s actually what I encounter frequently.
So I?m all for this feature. Would make coding without a second screen a
much, *much* more pleasant experience.

I believe this feature actually should be called 'focus
back_and_forth', and also
promote the focused container to the top of the screen.

Currently, with two floating container placed as you desired, no
keybinding could
change the focus between them, only mouse clicking could do.

Huh? Of course the normal bindings would work, since the overlapping
containers are only partly overlapping and an order is still defined.

I don?t care what you people do in third-party scripts (that?s what they
are there for, right? :)), but I consider it very unlikely that this
feature will be merged into core i3. It does not seem worth it to me to
add yet another weird special case, especially since it uses overlapping
windows. Ugh. As others have pointed out, i3 is primarily a tiling
window manager, and while other window managers may implement these
kinds of layouts, I am not convinced it?s a good idea in i3.

Hi Michael,

Likewise, thanks for the explanation.

I'll just drop what I had in mind in here in case someone else is interested to
whip up the script before I can get on with it.

I imagine that the script would have to handle two floating windows in order to
avoid further resizing after the initial setup. It should just basically move
and resize the windows to their places and bind a key to toggle them.

Hi, Eero,

I see the only thing missing here is a command for switching forcus
back_and_forth between containers. With this command, you can bind the
command to a key and manually make two floating windows overlapping,
then just using the keybinding to switch between them.

So here I am asking Michael, is it possible to add a command 'focus
back_and_forth' just like the existing 'workspace back_and_forth', so
that  what Eero is asking for is doable withouth scripting.

Of course, this command should promote the window to the top of the
screen, if it is floating. Currently, use keybing focusing a floating
window does not promote it to the top of the screen.

Regards,
Techlive

Hi Techlive,

"focus back_and_forth" could have it's uses, but I suspect that it would be
a bit more involved to implement. I would be happy for just the focused floating
window to be promoted to the top of the screen.

Everything I want almost works already; I can have a floating terminal and
a floating browser and "focus left" or "focus right" switches nicely between
them. The only thing missing is bringing the focused window on top.

Can't remember exactly what happened to that patch. I'm sure Michael had a
good argument for reverting the commit.
Still, this may be (or not) a good starting point for a new patch that can
get into (and stay) in i3's core.

Happy new year!

Thanks for the info Marcos. I did skim through the mail archives, but somehow
missed that thread.

Unfortunately at the moment I'm too busy (read: my C is too rusty) to dive into
the i3 sources.

Merry new years to you too!
