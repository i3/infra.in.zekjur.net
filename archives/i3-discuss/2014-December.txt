I had the same problem. In my case the IBus used the same shortcut. It has
an icon in the i3 tray, next to the clock.

Hi Michael,

I got a fix on this by removing the 'tray_output primary' from the config.

I still don't have any clue why this showed up in the first place, because
I remember that the 'tray_output primary' was set afterwards this issue
showed up.

Anyways, thanks for the help.

Subject: [i3] non-rectangular windows in i3
Message-ID: <CAHCisteF-srMD2aNBqHv-nnWHry8xFzepuSZJzqyQ8PsKsQiCw@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any way to render non-circular window correctly in i3?

most of the windows in i3 has always been using a rectangular border, but
recently when I installed the google hangouts chrome app
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/knipolnnllmklapflnccelgolnpehhpl?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon>,
I noticed that it had a circular window, which transforms into a rectangle
once it's clicked on, and transforms back into a circle when clicked again.

But on i3, the it still retains a rectangular window and looks weird
(screenshot of this is available at:
http://s2.postimg.org/f184crc15/i3_srsht.png).

PS: the same is applicable for synapse (
http://synapse.zeitgeist-project.com/) in it's default theme.

Is this a bug?

I think many of the hints that the Chrome hangouts app requires are
not supported in i3. I’m certainly in favor of fixing that, but I’m
not sure when I’ll get around to it. Perhaps that’s something for the
holidays…

(The usual caveat applies: if support for these hints introduces
unreasonable complexity, I reserve the right to reject them.)

Subject: [i3] I3-save-layout - the .json file is empty - bug or otherwise?
Message-ID: <loom.20141213T092504-465@post.gmane.org>

I'm using I3 4.8, have installed the perl modules AnyEvent::i3, JSON::XS and
AnyEvent::Handle, along with i3-save-layout.


When I run the command

 $ 'i3-save-tree --workspace 2: Ranger/NCMPCPP > .i3/ws2.2.json'

the resulting file contains just one line: 
$ cat .i3/ws2.2.json
// vim:ts=4:sw=4:et

When it should actually be containing the layout. Is this a bug, and why
does it happen? Or is it something else, related to dependencies?

Would really appreciate some input on this. Seems to be a neat and useful
feature.

Quoting workspace name makes the problem go away. Thank you.

Hello. At work I must use and old Ubuntu 11.04 version. So I limited to use
i3 with version 3.x

Sadly, the newest version of i3 is much more handy than previous one.

Could you please advise me how to build i3 statically linked? Thanks.

this does not answer, how to link it statically.

I have no real idea how to do that (and if it's possible) either. I
tried building using LDFLAGS=-static and replacing --libs in the
pkg-config by --static. That does not seem to be enough.

Message-ID: <CANnVG6mU-igNscfVJzLGEatAyF8iE1qMwA+ZbytveTFMzKky-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

For various reasons, I’d like to minimize the number of critical
services I host (and the number of custom solutions for common tasks).
Therefore, I’m moving the i3status and i3lock repositories to GitHub
as a test to see how well it works for our workflow/community/…

Instead of submitting patches for i3lock/i3status on cr.i3wm.org,
please send a pull request on https://github.com/i3/i3lock and
https://github.com/i3/i3status respectively. I’ve disabled issues and
wikis, as we’ll keep those at the current locations for now.

I’ll keep the existing repository locations around as best-effort
mirrors (which automatically pull from GitHub).

Michael
